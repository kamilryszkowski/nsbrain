Here‚Äôs how it works: 1) _Read books at ns.com/learn._ There‚Äôs a weekly list of books at ns.com/learn, all on various aspects of building startup societies, with links to get them on Amazon. 2) _Discuss books on Tuesday afternoon._ Each week, we‚Äôll hold a book club in the NS Cafe right before dinner time on Tuesday from 4-6pm.

The first hour prior to dinner will be silent reading, and the second hour will be live discussion, which you can continue during dinner at 6pm.

We‚Äôll group you for book club as we did for the mixer. 3) _Optionally, quiz and Warpcast review._ Each book has an optional quiz to self-test your understanding and get an NFT for your ns.com/profile.

For extra credit, write a book review (whether full post or tweet length) and post it from your warpcast.com account. **The First Three NS Books** Most books on our list relate to startup societies, but the first week's curriculum is focused on self-improvement: a) _Atomic Habits_ is James Clear‚Äôs guide to programming yourself b) _Navalmanack_ is my friend Naval‚Äôs guide to building wealth c) And _Tools of Titans_ is Tim Ferriss‚Äôs collection of successful heuristics from the successful Why assign these three first?

We're front-loading these three in particular so you can keep going back to them in the weeks/months that follow to keep getting value out of them.

These types of books generate compound interest.

Think of this as the ""win"" part of ""win-and-help-win"", the individual self-improvement part that's a daily part of the Network School Curriculum. **Next Steps** OK.

As next steps, all you have to do is: a) get the books on Kindle via [ns.com/learn](https://ns.com/learn) and b) sign up for the first book club from 4-6pm on Tuesday via [lu.ma/61pn7tfw](https://lu.ma/61pn7tfw) We'll assign groups like for the mixer prior to Tuesday at 4pm.

See you then!"

I‚Äôm Billy Jo, from S.Korea.

I went to high school in Australia, then studied Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, mixing AI and philosophy.

In college, I learned that I‚Äôm better at explaining tech than coding, which later led to my [YouTube](http://youtube.com/@bjunjo) and [Substack](https://billyjo.substack.com/).

Career-wise, I started as a business development rep, then worked as a data analyst at [Gong](http://gong.io) in Silicon Valley, digging into sales data and linking tech with clients.

Did BD role again briefly, launched my content platforms with a decent following on Bitcoin and AI, then joined [Antler Korea](https://www.antler.co/location/korea) as a Founder-in-Residence, securing some government grants.

Now, I‚Äôm learning how to angel investing with [Lightning Ventures](https://ltng.ventures) syndicate.

I joined NS to figure out why and how to run my own fund‚Äîinvesting in Bitcoin startups, robot (or deep tech) startups, El Salvador fixed-income bonds, and Bitcoin treasury company bonds/warrants as an institutional investor.

Why?

To back systems and tech that shift how things work.

How?

I‚Äôd love your ideas on structuring it and finding the right moves.

Excited to connect and swap thoughts!

Super excited to be here!

I‚Äôm Harsh from Jaipur, India, and I'm joining NS today, March 1st!

I‚Äôve been building software for the past six years, mostly helping early-stage startups get their MVPs off the ground and setting up their tech stacks.

I‚Äôve also been a founding engineer at a couple of startups, and until recently, I was at a YC company‚Äîdecided it was time to move on and finally build something of my own.

I‚Äôve been in the crypto space since 2015 and genuinely believe Bitcoin should be the currency of the future.

Fun fact: I actually met Balaji in 2022 at the Singapore Fintech Festival!

When he first tweeted last year, ‚ÄúWe got an island,‚Äù I knew I had to be part of this and applied right away.

Really looking forward to meeting like-minded folks, exchanging ideas, and diving into all the events‚Äîespecially hackathons (won a few in the past, so definitely up for the challenge!).

Joining NS on March 1!

Chinese-American, studied cognitive science at UC Berkeley.

Explored tech in Silicon Valley (VR/AR, 3D printing, crypto, maker culture).

Currently traveling Southeast Asia after two years in Mexico City.

My work spans education (built makerspaces for 10,000+ high schoolers in Peru/Colombia), health (co-founded IBDCoach), crypto (community strategy @ web3 venture studio and protocols), and now AI.

For the last three years, I've focused entirely on AI‚Äîbuilding and deploying ideas quickly.

Currently building Speak To Earn to empower native speakers from low-resource communities, helping create AI that reflects humanity's linguistic diversity.

Recently won two first place prizes at the Safe Agentathon (https://devfolio.co/projects/yapper-9cfd).

I think deeply about starting conditions for products, communities, and societal transformation.

At scale, startup societies are an alignment problem‚Äîbringing the right people together around shared values.

My time living in Mexico for two years has shown me how communities form around values rather than geography.

This journey led me to Network School, where I hope to find high agency, creative people to collaborate with.

I spend most of my time vibe coding with AI and focusing on my health and meditating.

Core values: Freedom, Growth, Connection.

Interests: AI, crypto, vibe coding, frontier / startup societies, human-ai collaboration / intelligence augmentation, speaking new languages, future of user interfaces, history, philosophy.

Currently studying with Math Academy to dive deeper into AI/ML.

Hobbies: FOOD (ran a 900-person foodies group in CDMX), boxing, AI art, music. https://x.com/thealexyao Looking forward to meeting and connecting with everyone!"

I‚Äôm Gabi, and I‚Äôll be arriving with my husband and our sons on April 1st (my husband, <@501503366350766116> , has already introduced himself above). ü•≥ I was born in Budapest, Hungaryüá≠üá∫ , but I also lived in Mexico üá≤üáΩ and Brazil üáßüá∑ as a child.

For the past three years, we‚Äôve been living in Bali. üå¥ Originally, I trained as a lawyer and worked in television before having kids, mainly in international program acquisitions.

Then, in 2013, my husband founded MrCoin, Hungary‚Äôs first Bitcoin exchange, and I was involved in that journey as well. <:bitcoin:1282286965794017280> It was incredibly exciting to introduce the then-unknown concept of Bitcoin to Hungary and to help build and educate the community around it.

We organized Bitcoin film festivals, gave talks, and produced the Bitcoin segment for Hungary‚Äôs most well-known financial radio show weekly for many years.

One of the highlights of this journey was unveiling the world‚Äôs first Satoshi statue in Budapest, which has since become a global symbol of Satoshi.

We‚Äôre very proud of that!

Fun fact: the statue was originally planned to have a hat, I was the one who convinced the team that the statue absolutely had to have a hood. üôÉ .

I‚Äôm not a tech person by nature ‚Äî I‚Äôm more interested in how technology and society influence each other.

This applies to both cryptocurrencies and AI.

I‚Äôm not so much focused on what happens at the code level, but rather how these innovations can be used for the benefit of humanity, maximizing their positive impact while minimizing potential risks. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚òÆÔ∏è ü´Ç I have a deep passion for working with children. üíó üö∏ As a UNICEF volunteer for years, I helped run interactive workshops on children's rights and the realities of kids living in different parts of the world.

I‚Äôm a Third Culture Kid (TCK), and my sons are as well, so I have extensive experience‚Äîboth as a former TCK myself and now as a parent‚Äîon what it means to grow up across multiple countries.

I understand the advantages and challenges of this lifestyle and how to enhance the positives while mitigating the difficulties.

I even wrote a children's book on this topic, which won the ""Children‚Äôs Book of the Year"" award in Hungary in 2024.

Additionally, I run educational Facebook groups in Hungary on topics like TCK kids, as well as women and AI.

I am the co-founder of an indie book publishing company in Hungary called Zazie Books.

Beyond this, I have a background in journalism, political analysis, mediation, and coaching.

I‚Äôm currently furthering my education to specialize in coaching children as well. üë©‚Äçüéì My father was a member of Hungary‚Äôs first freely elected government after the fall of the communist regime, which gave me a deep insight from a young age into how a traditional nation-state operates.

This, along with my legal background, makes it fascinating for me to rethink the role and function of the state from the ground up.

This is one reason why I find NS so exciting.

My husband and I also share a goal of creating a space, school, and workshops for the children of NS residents ‚Äî ensuring they can grow and evolve alongside the adults.

After all, while we‚Äôre trying to figure out what the future will look like, they are the ones who will live in it the longest, so I believe it's essential to involve them in shaping it. üöÄ I have no harmful addictions‚Äîunless you count books, movies, and contemporary art and architecture... üòä I‚Äôm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and would love to chat and exchange ideas on any of these topics.

Programming the new earth / heaven on earth economy.

I moved to silicon valley when it was cool, at Apple ATG initially, later some startups, then left before it became uncool, was a digital nomad in Thailand, living the dream, mountain villa, wife, 2 kids, car - then ended up taking 3 years off on a spiritual path, sat with teachers and Gurus, became determined to reach enlightenment, meditated, found the most direct teachings, ended up in Bali without the ex-wife but with the kids which was / is epic, they are the best üòâ One day, I became aware of reality - and that was enough for me and I got the message, back to work now!

The next day, I was hired as CTO of an ICO play - it fell apart quickly, but I learned a lot.

Then I worked on Seeds and Hypha DAO, a conscious currency and a DAO platform.

I am very much interested in the idea of network state; it is very clear to me that society is collapsing, not fit for a new state of consciousness emerging on earth, and the vision was always to build the new earth instead of fighting the old.

Been on this journey for 6 years now - it's going to happen.

Burning man was my inspiration for what an utopian society can look like - everyone volunteers, everyone does what they like to do, and everything gets done synchronistically.

A giving economy.

But before we get there on a large scale and in the real world, blockchain is our bridge - to get out of the money slave system and create peace on earth.

Any currency that's not corrupted basically would do - but blockchain is a technology that just so happens to fit the bill.

Excited to meet you all on March 1st!"

I‚Äôm Andre, I‚Äôll be joining TNS in April.

Currently based in New York.

About me ‚Äî I enjoy being at the frontier of new technology and exploring the ways that technology and society interact.

Over the years, I‚Äôve been an investor and have built several projects in the crypto space.

A few things I‚Äôm proud of: - Launched a protocol to use Bitcoin in smart contracts, currently with $100M+ in value locked - Was an early employee at the company that invented the first use of zero knowledge proofs (which are now widely used to create privacy-preserving and scalable systems) - Worked with governments around the US to research how crypto can create better systems and empower communities. - Built a financial literacy program to introduce New York students to the crypto industry.

While I‚Äôm at TNS, I‚Äôd love to work on building a platform for a Bitcoin-aligned network state.

I believe a society built around sound money enables humanity to flourish and this is now possible through advancements in layer 2 technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy strength training, biking, yoga, hiking, reading, learning, cooking.

Alongside my entrepreneurial ventures, I‚Äôve also been an active investor in the crypto space, always on the lookout for groundbreaking opportunities.

I‚Äôm thrilled to have joined Network School in March, and I‚Äôm deeply inspired by Balaji‚Äôs visionary concept of the Network State.

I believe this idea has the potential to reshape the way we approach entrepreneurship, community-building, and innovation.

It‚Äôs exciting to think about how we can apply these principles to create something truly impactful.

For me, entrepreneurship is all about turning ideas into reality‚Äîtaking a concept from 0 to 1.

It‚Äôs about solving real problems, challenging the status quo, and creating value for others.

I‚Äôve learned that success in this space requires resilience, creativity, and a willingness to learn from failures.

I‚Äôd love to collaborate with like-minded individuals here to co-create, experiment, and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

At Network School, I‚Äôm looking forward to embracing the ""Learn, Burn, Earn, and Fun"" mindset.

I‚Äôm excited to dive into the curriculum, contribute my experiences, and grow alongside such a talented and passionate community.

Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together‚Äîinnovate, hustle, and have a blast while doing it!"

Amiee here!

I‚Äôll be joining Network School on April 1st and super excited to be here!

I just graduated from the University of Sydney and had worked as an ESG Analyst in Sydney and as a Private Equity Analyst in Shenzhen.

Now, I‚Äôm focused on launching my own Tibetan incense brand and connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.

I‚Äôm also deeply passionate about yoga and Vipassana meditation, which have been transformative to me.

Vipassana is a technique that helps bring the unconscious mind to the surface.

As Goenka said, there are three kinds of thoughts: one is like ripples on the water, fleeting and temporary; another like a line drawn on the sand, easily washed away by the waves.

But the third is an imprint carved into stone, lasting through time.

This third kind is what‚Äôs stored deep in the iceberg of our unconscious mind, secretly influencing our behaviors‚Äîwhat we often call fate.

Practicing Vipassana has been the greatest gift of the past year, and I hope to share this experience with others.

Also!

I‚Äôll be in Mt.

Gambier for a Deep Week to get my Wave 2 certification, so I‚Äôll be in Sydney/Melbourne from March 12-24.

Catch me for a coffee if you're around!

SIN has a bus shuttle but I have to get off for cross border immigration and online comments show it takes quite some time at peak hours.

If you're traveling via Singapore, you'll need to go through another visa process.

If that's not an issue, SIN is a good option since it's closer to Forest City.

Otherwise, you can fly to Kuala Lumpur, take a flight from there to Senai, and then a cab to Forest City.

If you're in a neighboring country like Indonesia or Thailand, you might find direct flights to Senai, which could be another option."

We‚Äôre a fast-growing startup that‚Äôs revolutionizing the job search process with AI and Machine Learning‚Äîalready @ 7 figures in revenue profitably in just a few years & growing quickly.

We‚Äôre looking for a Chief of Staff for a high-impact, cross-functional role working across marketing, sales, product, and engineering.

This isn‚Äôt just an operational role; it‚Äôs a launchpad to a COO position at a company that‚Äôs already changing lives‚Äîhelping job seekers land $50K+ salary bumps and even double their income.

Why this role is exciting: üî• Work directly with a Columbia-educated, ex-McKinsey founder who has sourced deals for investors behind Netflix, Tinder, and AngelList üìà Scale an already successful cold email system from 50K to 100K+ weekly emails üí∞ Help optimize tens of thousands of job applications per month to increase conversion rates and revenue üöÄ Fast-paced, high-growth environment with a clear path to COO üí° Work with AI, automation, and cutting-edge growth strategies Super open to having you work remotely, but there‚Äôs potential for relocation as the company scales.

Compensation includes a significant commission-based component, ideal for someone hungry to grow and directly impact the company‚Äôs success & join me and my other business partners as we scale.

This doesn‚Äôt need experience, just RAW IQ, horsepower, and the desire to co-run a company that‚Äôs already crushing it.

Mostly I like to work either as freelancer, consultant, remote jobs or on my own products and research ideas.

One reason I am particularly excited about network school is because I believe this is how communities and even nations of future should work.

Grouping people based on their shared values and interests makes so much more sense than grouping based on geographical location of birth.

Also, I believe that it's not just opportunity but also our responsibility to have a specific vision for the world we want to see when technology makes EVERYTHING possible because pre-internet era institutions won't survive post-AGI era.

IMO, one right direction would be to create a world of abundance and compassion for all biological beings.

So far, it was Natural selection that helped in gene improvement but it also led to so much cruelty and suffering because it is based on scarcity of resources and zero sum competition.

In world of abundance, we can just program genes and improve them in specific directions we want.

All the species should be augmented with artificial intelligence and inter-species communication should be made possible so that planet earth actually becomes a much more healthy and happy place to live.

Some projects I am exploring currently - - Possibility of test-time reasoning in spatial domain instead of just text domain. (Make models shape rotators rather than just wordcels). - A better UI for LLMs using graphs instead of linear chats.

‚Ä¢ For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same‚Äîthis is still ongoing and one of the main reasons I applied to NS.

‚Ä¢ Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto‚Äîsetting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.).

‚Ä¢ Learning a lot about AI‚Äîboth top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).

‚Ä¢ Beginner Muay Thai learner‚Äîwould love to take classes at NS.

Anyone else interested in learning or teaching?

Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, etc., are also on the table.

Let‚Äôs connect! **Network School** I‚Äôll be arriving in April, and my first project will be setting up a microschool/homeschooling community to make it easier for families to stay at NS for extended periods.

The model will follow the **2-hour model / Alpha School approach**, where kids learn autonomously with AI tutors at their own pace‚Äîwithout human tutors for the basic core curriculum.

Next, the microschool would expand to afternoon sessions led by human coaches/mentors/motivators.

Their role would be to help kids discover their passions, cultivate curiosity, and become 10x versions of themselves through human collaboration and AI.

The focus would be on life skills, soft skills, and preparing for the future.

The ultimate goal: involve kids in **building the future of society**‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs their future, and they should help shape it as soon as possible.

I hope to bootstrap this as quickly as possible.

If you‚Äôre interested‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre bringing kids, planning to stay long-term, or want to be involved‚Äîplease reach out!

I‚Äôll be at NS in April, then taking a short break before returning in June/July and staying until the end.

My plan is to get the microschool up and running quickly so my family can join long-term next academic year‚Äîand to make it easier for other families to come.

There‚Äôs no society without families and kids, so this will be my top priority.

I should probably put this intro on a website instead of dropping this wall of text here üòÖ Anyway, excited to be here!

And seriously‚Äîif you‚Äôre interested in the microschool or coming with kids, let‚Äôs connect. https://x.com/keo https://warpcast.com/keo604 [linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/)"

I grew up as an expat kid in Algeria and have been living in Bali for the past three years.

I consider myself a builder, with a strong software engineering background‚ÄîI started coding at five.

I love solving problems that others think are unsolvable, with a strong emphasis on user experience.

Growing up in Algeria and then in a post-Soviet country, I failed a lot and learned to crawl through broken glass to make it.

I‚Äôm a cockroach, not a unicorn.

A cockroach with a Liberland passport üôÇ I‚Äôm excited to join the Network School because I rarely meet like-minded individuals who are extreme risk-takers, fanatically love reimagining difficult problems from first principles, and embrace, learn from, and enjoy all the associated challenges. **Things I value:**

‚Ä¢ **Human connections** ‚Äì Honesty, Empathy, Love

‚Ä¢ **Self-sovereignty, Liberty** ‚Äì NAP, Voluntarism

‚Ä¢ **Spending time offline** ‚Äì Enjoying the analogue waves

‚Ä¢ **Building online** ‚Äì Crunching digital bits **Things I care about:**

‚Ä¢ The future of society

‚Ä¢ Posthumanism

‚Ä¢ Everything that can be derived from the above two:

‚Ä¢ Detaching from the legacy system to become free, borderless, and crypto-native

‚Ä¢ Building a new societal blueprint

‚Ä¢ Safe superintelligence

‚Ä¢ Health, safe food, longevity, sports

‚Ä¢ 22nd-century education

‚Ä¢ Preparing for what‚Äôs to come in the next five years - and what's to come after **A few fun things I‚Äôve done:**

‚Ä¢ Got together with a dozen people to create a community/village of like-minded techno-optimists.

The project failed, but I learned a lot about biointensive farming‚Äîand it‚Äôs also where I discovered Bitcoin (this was in 2010).

Back then, we used Bitcoin as money to trade veggies, land, labor, etc.

No one thought of it as ‚ÄúHODL never spend digital gold.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Bootstrapped Hungary‚Äôs crypto ecosystem‚Äî[founded the first exchange/brokerage](https://mrcoin.eu) (since exited), launched ATMs (with a highly ranked central bank officer [praising Bitcoin at the inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDvEgqsbZow)üòÖ), organized educational workshops, meetups, etc.

Fun fact: We have the longest-running [Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.bitcoinbudapest.hu) in the world!

‚Ä¢ Erected the first [Satoshi Statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/em74TdeSsbw?t=2363s) in Budapest, which became a pilgrimage site for crypto enthusiasts (and is now the default ‚ÄúSatoshi image‚Äù in the press).

‚Ä¢ Built a small GPU rig to learn about mining‚Äîand it ended up mining Ethereum‚Äôs [genesis block](https://x.com/keo/status/1272844823834308608).

‚Ä¢ Helped fund and bootstrap a pirate microschool/homeschooling club for my son 10 years ago because we couldn‚Äôt find any alternatives we were happy with.

This later became a state-accredited [decentralized network of 18 microschools](https://budapestschool.org/en/) with 800+ students in Hungary.

‚Ä¢ Co-founded [Reaction](https://reaction.global) with Stanford Executive Program classmates‚Äîa VC fund focused on solving important problems."

Been fixing hardware and cracking into my neighbors WEP ‚Äú*secured*‚Äù WiFi since I was 13 since we couldn't afford working computers or internet.

I got a job in networking when I was 18, and have since graduated the University of Houston with a BS in Computer Information Systems.

Somewhere in between there I learned about crypto (I will only answer the question ‚Äú*how*‚Äù over a Moutai) and I‚Äôve been hooked for nearly the last 10 years.

In my day-job, I work at a global accounting firm where I teach professionals why they need to care about crypto and how it works.

I also am in the process of scaling our blockchain community.

I love what I do, but I‚Äôll be taking a month off of that to come see what the Network School is all about in July.

After (*during*) work I also work on whatever side-projects I think would be fun, scalable, and make me a millionaire before 30 (I‚Äôve got 9 months left).

My favorite one right now is a Twitter page that automatically enhances and highlights AI art that I handpick, though it hasn't made me any money (yet).

When I‚Äôm not doing that, I love to workout (actually hate it), walk in the sun, be at the beach, play basketball (big one), and win Marvel Rivals games (plat now, but just getting started).

Excited to be here and looking forward to connecting.

I‚Äôm Ursula O‚ÄôKuinghttons, and my journey has always been about stories, whether it‚Äôs interviewing migrants searching for a new home or Heads of State shaping the future.

I started in journalism at Prisa Media (Spain), covering major global events and expanding media across Europe, Spain and Latin America.

But in 2012, I became fascinated by the idea that technology, specifically blockchain, could rebuild the media industry, making it more transparent, independent, and resilient.

That curiosity led me to ConsenSys, where I was a founding member of Civil, one of the first attempts to decentralize journalism.

Later, as Director of Communications and Partnerships at the Web3 Foundation in Switzerland, I helped to launchPolkadot.

Now, as CMO of Scytale Digital VC and an advisor to Project Liberty (Frequency blockchain), I‚Äôm focused on building bridges between technology, media, and business.

Project Liberty recently made a bid to acquire TikTok in the US with the goal of decentralizing it.

We shall see how that unfolds, but the ambition is clear: put control back into the hands of users.

A few exciting things ahead: I‚Äôm organizing Decentralize Lugano, a finance-focused event in Switzerland, in May 8th, and I‚Äôll also be at ETH Denver, where we‚Äôre hosting Frequency House, and Merge Buenos Aires, where I‚Äôll be presenting a Web3 documentary on FC Barcelona, a project I‚Äôm proud to be part of.

I‚Äùll be joining the NS In August, I‚Äôll be moving to Singapore with my 12-year-old son, and we‚Äôre both looking forward to this new chapter.

If you‚Äôre around at any of these events or in Singapore, let‚Äôs connect!"

Recently, this included writing a pilot screenplay for a streaming series called Imagi Nation; it is a ‚Äúpoli fi‚Äù [political science fiction] story about the founding of the first global-scale Network State.

Before that, I wrote a blog called Expat Nation, anticipating many of the ideas that Balaji advocated in The Network State.

I arrived yesterday evening from Vienna, Austria üá¶üáπ and will stay until 16.12.

Made a friend ""Awais"" üá≥üá¥ today and we went to Singapore but ended up in a historical Supreme Court holding cell! (unfortunately looks like I can't insert a funny picture related to that on discord) A couple weeks ago I bet a bunch of money on Polymarket that Trump is gonna win, won 10k$ but, of course, got addicted immediately.

So then I bet a bunch of more money that there'll be a ceasefire in the Ukraine war before Trump's inauguration; so I'm a bit tense and constantly checking my phone for news related to that event.

I'm on vacation so am not held back by my day job.

I'm Gokhan, originally from Turkey.

After graduating from university, I moved to China, where I spent 4 years in Beijing and another 4 in Shenzhen.

I‚Äôve been in the crypto space since 2017, starting as one of the first foreign employees at Huobi's Beijing HQ.

Now, I lead investment and research at IOSG Ventures, and had the chance to invest early in many of today's transformative projects.

In my free time, I enjoy running, football (the kind you actually play with your feet), and hitting the gym.

I‚Äôm Chinese-American from Midwest but mostly exited the US since around 10 years ago, first moving to Brasil and then now in Southeast Asia in the Philippines.

Got two young sons who I hope to be netizens of network societies in the future.

For much of my life, I‚Äôve tried to as a neutral avoid collateral damage from the escalating US-China conflict, but the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù somehow always comes back ‚Äî most recently in the form of nearly monthly South China Sea scares near the Philippines (which could rock the entire Indo-Pacific region) and fears of return of McCarthyism by US/US ‚Äúvassals‚Äù (not so much about the ‚Äúanti-Communist‚Äù part but concerns rooted in the potentially unfair and unethical targeting of particular minority disapora groups).

I am thankful for the frameworks that Balaji has envisioned - for it gives me hope that milions of neutrals, nomads, migrants, third-culture-kids, etc can try to find peaceful independent alternate paths for themselves and their families ‚Äî hopefully peacefully independent from clutches of legacy nation states that have power to commit violence, confiscation, cancellation, suspicion, persecution, and shaming of those accused of being not ‚Äúnationalistic/patriotic‚Äù enough or accused of not loving ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù enough.

Hoping for a future in which my kids and others in their generation would no longer be judged or limited by the color of their passport/national id/social security card. (Nowadays, to be born, to go to school, to get employed, to travel globally, to get married, to have kids, to retire, and even to die and pass on inheritance ‚Äî one would need recognition from a nation state!).

Nothing against nation states, respecting them, just seeking peaceful alternatives.

I look forward to learning from everyone ‚Äî it is a blessing to connect with and learn from so many thinkers, innovators, entreprenuers, and aspiring network state/network society netizens in this community.

I am humbled to have the chance to learn ‚Äî and I hope to continue to come back to Forest City from time to time.

A big thanks to Balaji and the NS team for making things happen.

Cheers!"

I‚Äôm Adria, and I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of the Network School.

I‚Äôm a content creator focusing on crypto and self-exploration, aiming to make Web3 more accessible to those outside the industry.

I‚Äôm also passionate about dance and love exploring the connection between the body and mind.

I‚Äôd love to organize a sunset dance group by the beach, creating a space for movement and creativity.

During my time here, I hope to: 1.

Discover a balanced, high-energy approach to both life and work. 2.

Develop a personal business model and create a solid MVP loop. 3.

Learn how to use AI for video creation (I hope to create a complete sci-fi short film with AI) Looking forward to this journey together!"

I'm Marie, I'm a full stack dev and designer.

I love to craft things so I learned illustrator, a tiny bit of animation and some 3D.

Would love to have more time to dedicate to this though I've been in the crypto space for 3 years now and love talking about tech, society, opensource, monetary policies, history,decentralization.

How do we create new decentralized platforms, new community currencies and in the end new states?

I'm mostly aligned with the cyberpunk ethos so in this search for meaning in the crypto sea, I spent some time in - the ReFI (regenerative finance) space, trying to put a value on nature.

I'm very interested in the food industry and how it could be improved - governance and more recently futarchy: governance by the markets.

It's been a pretty interesting path of thinking for me - i'm learning about cryptography, zk and privacy.

It's time to focus on this before everything is traceable I'm currently building an app called ascend https://x.com/ascend_sh : an accountability social network that lets you stake and bet on the completion of a routine or a task with your friends.

Could be sport, pushing commits on github, twetting more, anything.

It's still very early and we plan to launch soon, would love to do some user interviews with you guys.

I could only stay 8 days sadly but it's already something and I want to take the most out of it.

I'm super excited to see new things on the search for the network states and would love to find a way to contribute to it (agricultural projects to have good quality food, help building online tools, ...).

Most of the time, these are exclusive because there's a large number of applicants + it could also depend on how they're filtering applicants based on views/opinions, proof-of-work or any number of categories.

As they scale, they will increase capacity.

The best way to get accepted is to start contributing early & voluntarily, not just to attend but to build something that you also believe in.

That'll almost guarantee a spot and also lead to making new friends before you even go there.

Good luck!"

Gary here from Vancouver.

I've been a renegade filmmaker since the 1990's and an ardent advocate of Open-Source Everything since the early 2000s.

I co-founded the Decentralized Dance Party (DDP) in 2009 and in the years since, have hosted over 100 roaming ""Open-Source"" street Parties in many cities across the globe, turning hundreds of thousands of people on to Radical Decentralization and new modes of social and societal possibility!

Check it out at http://TheDDP.com I've also been deeply involved in the greater crypto / Decentralization community since 2011, with many written works, short films, co-founding Camp Dogecoin at Burning Man 2014, Camp Decentral at Burning Man 2017, DogeCon Vancouver, the Dogecoin Foundation in 2021, Million Doge Disco, the DogeClaren and many other projects and initiatives üôÇ Also attended Vitalia / Prospera this past February, met a bunch of the folks in the movement and had a great experience.

I've been fascinated by the prospect of a ""Network State"" for many years and have been discussing and brainstorming such a venture for quite some time.

I am EXTREMELY excited to contribute to the movement and see limitless possibility here in Forest City and beyond!

Excited to be laying the groundwork with all y'all for a maximally free, peaceful and prosperous future!

I‚Äôm Ryan Lackey, have been doing cypherpunk stuff since the early 1990s ‚Äî on the original list, dropped out of high school for MIT and then dropped out of MIT to do a gold backed anonymous digital currency in Anguilla (to get around ITAR), then did the world‚Äôs first offshore datahaven on an abandoned ww2 anti-aircraft fort and self declared sovereign country.

Bootstrapped a defense contractor in war zones, then a YC-funded secure virtualization company (S11) which I sold to Cloudflare and worked there for a couple years.

Did a disposable laptop company for China/Russia high risk travel, then moved to Switzerland when I joined a crypto foundation board and helped them to a top-10 market cap launch.

Then moved to Puerto Rico where I now do crypto insurance, investing, and some anonymous payments and infra for network states stuff.

I‚Äôve been traveling 200+ days/yr for about 25 years and am super excited about network states generally and network school in particular.

I wanted to formally introduce myself as I won't be able to attend the conference and the first 2 weeks - I'll be at a friend's wedding and will join you all on October 4.

I am fascinated by Network States and grateful for the work the NS team has done to put this together.

My FOMO is at an all-time high missing the first bit!

I'm Shar from Vancouver.

My entrepreneurial background spans multiple industries including agrichemicals, cannabis, real estate, entertainment, and some tech (an area I'm hoping to expand on).

I've worked on pre-IPO capital raises, advised startup founders, and served on a co-op board (lots of parallels with web3).

I thrive in project-based sprints, working with small, motivated teams to solve exciting problems.

I'm coming off a six-year sprint building and exiting a cannabis company.

The past year has been exploratory, focusing on new ways of work and refining not just what I want to work on, but how.

Themes of particular interest: -Digital products and apps -Audience-first building -AI-driven low-cost development -Projects beyond excessive regulatory scrutiny -[as Balaji discusses regarding the administrative state](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWMcRRkuak>) These align with my belief that smaller teams can do high-leverage work (@naval speaks about this a lot -[see page 60 of the Almanack of Naval Ravikant](<https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf>).

Long-term, I aim to build skills and a network for a venture studio-type model, creating tasteful projects for people with audiences (yes, this could be a DAO, my crypto friends).

NS couldn't have come at a better time.

Inspired by [Levelsio's 12 projects in 12 months](<https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>), my goal is to collaborate on ""indie hacker"" type projects.

Instead of solo development, multiple people with domain expertise building, testing, and launching projects quickly.

See what fails or gains traction, focusing on building for or with an audience.

I have a few projects I've been building with my own network but would be cool to build with some likeminded NS admits -would be extra cool to look at projects we could build for the NS community!

If this interests you, feel free to DM me or start a thread.

Looking forward to connecting!

Have fun at the conference, everyone - I'll be watching online!"

Joining the Network School feels like it's the ""connecting the dots"" moment in my life!

I‚Äôm 22 years old and have been homeschooled since I was 10.

In 2019, I founded China‚Äôs only homeschooler community.

The desire to see the community achieve prosperity through emergence led me to explore organizational development, which is how I recognize DAO.

Once my anarchist spirit met crypto, there was no turning back.

Over the past five years, I‚Äôve been involved in over 100 projects without attending college.

About 30% didn‚Äôt fail, and 3% were a big success.

Last year, as a digital nomad at Zuzalu, I began to wonder why college couldn‚Äôt be nomadic, prove yourself with portfolio instead of diploma?

I tried to bring this idea to life with hundreds of co-creators and got $206,000 in pledged donations, but everything was shut down by the Political Security Bureau in China.

I nearly ended up in jail.

They feared the education for freedom and the infiltration through crypto investment.

After that, I realized it was time to leave China and build on a global scale.

So when I saw the Network School, I know it's where I should come."

My name is Max Kordek.

My specialization is in technology, crypto and futurism.

In crypto since nearly 13 years, founder since 8 years when it all started with Lisk for which I collected 14,000 BTC in 2016.

I founded: - Onchain Foundation, a non-profit crypto venture builder and research institute - Lisk, originally a JavaScript L1, now a L2 part of Optimism‚Äôs/Base‚Äôs Superchain - Pass App, a smart wallet using account abstraction - Lightcurve, Berlin‚Äôs longest-standing blockchain agency I‚Äôm a big advocate of the idea behind network states, and I‚Äôm big into health and longevity.

After being at Bryan Johnson‚Äôs house last week, it became apparent to me that I need to dive much deeper into technology and longevity!

Therefore, the Network School sounds like the perfect opportunity for me!

My intention is to stay on the island for the entire time (only being away for short business trips in October and November), while being there I‚Äôd like to challenge myself and build a small project from scratch, get physically super-fit, and soak up as much knowledge from the school and participants as possible.

Moreover, it‚Äôs not just where the world is headed; it's a blueprint for accelerating our most ambitious endeavors.

The Network State seems like our best hope at creating a bedrock for true progress, reshaping possibilities not to not just only sovereignty, but also the human superpower of cooperation, and unencumbered innovation across diverse spheres (e.g., catalyzing breakthroughs like the gene therapies emerging in Pr√≥spera, Honduras).

My name is Lane.

I was born and raised in the oil fields of the Midwestern United States before moving to sunny California at the age of 18 to study computer science.

Growing up in a family business instilled in me a great appreciation for value creation, individual sovereignty, personal responsibility, and rugged entrepreneurship from a young age.

I‚Äôm interested in absolutely everything but my favorite project right now is a suite of software that uses ML to evaluate seismic data and locate new oil reserves with ~90+% accuracy.

I‚Äôve traveled the world for the past few years and couldn‚Äôt agree more with Balaji‚Äôs vision for the Network State.

We need to move beyond centralized states that maintain power through fiat, war-mongering, and sowing division.

I envision a future comprised of sovereign individuals who maintain peace and trust through smart contracts and blockchain and increasingly democratize economic opportunity through innovation ‚Äúin the world of bits and atoms‚Äù as Thiel would say.

Balaji‚Äôs courage and foresight in organizing something of this magnitude is simply incredible.

Witnessing how stronger financial resources opened doors for my peers to globally renowned opportunities, which in turn led to even more, was a major reality check for me. - This experience fueled my 'chip on my shoulder' to create and pursue global opportunities, even while being homebound - It also cemented my strong belief in crypto as the decentralized and open financial system of our generation, allowing me to work alongside global talent, regardless of where we‚Äôre based.

Lately, though, I‚Äôve started feeling jaded by the PvP nature of our crypto space.

I‚Äôm looking forward to my time in NS to meet fresh faces, reignite my enthusiasm for the industry, and cut through the noise.

Can't wait to meet and grow with everyone over the coming months!

My journey has been a mix of successes and failures - I've had 3 startups that didn't make it, managed to sell 1, and now I'm working on building another.

Alongside this, I'm also building a new business with AI, exploring the exciting possibilities in this field. ü§ñ But I'm very much a beginner in these areas, eager to learn from all of you who have such impressive backgrounds.

My time in the corporate world was interesting, as I never had a fixed position within any company.

I enjoyed problem-solving, so I eventually ended up becoming a consultant, helping manufacturing suppliers reduce scrap and meet OEM standards.

After working in the automotive and Aerospace industries for 10 years, the pandemic accelerated my journey to become fully independent and finally broke away from the corporate world.

Being an artist was always in the back of my mind, and Web3 introduced me to a new world where art and engineering are celebrated.

I have been creating products and experiences in Web3 since 2021 and shipped my first game in early 2024.

It wasn‚Äôt an easy journey, but it was something I needed to go through.

Me and my wife (who was also accepted in NS <:newcountry:994308986578935958> ) run an Indie gaming studio and also create courses on the side to help creators break out of their shell.

I'm Milan from the Netherlands, also known as Mira Hurley on Twitter (it's a long story..) My background is mostly finance and economics, having founded my own companies in the sector, worked for the Dutch central bank where I learnt just how slow-moving institutions can be, and having first encountered Bitcoin in 2012.

Nowadays I'm a self-taught programmer, together with my co-founder we built NanoGPT which uses crypto to allow anyone, anywhere to access the best LLMs and image generation tools.

The Network School is genuinely the perfect combination of everything that I'm excited about:- crypto & AI are my main interests and fill my professional life nowadays, Bryan Johnson is the inspiration for our health protocol, Balaji's (and Patri Friedman's!) vision of the future of states is the kind of future I want to see (and help build) and since my girlfriend also got accepted we even get to do this together.

On a sidenote we're broadly being declared crazy by friends and family for ""joining this cult"" since this is starting just after we got back from a 6-month trip through South America, but I'm super excited about it.

I'm hoping we can make it to the Network State Conference in time.

The previous one in Amsterdam was great so if anyone is doubting I can really recommend it.

I initially got into crypto when I was 15 because I wanted to start trading but couldn't get onboarded onto traditional brokers.

I then learned about the permissionless nature of public blockchains and the ideology behind it, never left since.

At the end of my studies I then joined one crypto startup doing on-chain private credit, and then co-founded a portfolio management startup where I designed investment strategies based on on-chain data for token selection & rebalancing among other things.

I am also quite interested in AI, and created some personal projects (one of which is an AI agent focused on summarizing student's slides and books to learn more efficiently).

I decided to join the network school because I was at a point in my life where I figured I needed more personal experiences to know myself & where I want to go in the future better, and be able to learn from very interesting people from all over the world.

I also love playing Frisbee (will bring one if anyone wants to chill on the beach durring the sunset), swimming, Music, and experimenting with new technologies I look forward to meeting you all!"

Personal Productivity Systems & Utilities.** I‚Äôm interested in structures that help people design-and-operate their life.

From the lowest level todo lists to the highest level aspirations and vision boards.

I‚Äôm still sitting in the question of how AI advancements can transform how we design our lives and get things done. **2.

Blueprint.** Making any aspects of the Blueprint protocol more accessible to consumers. **3.

Burning Man.** I‚Äôm coming fresh out of Burning Man and have some ideas.

Is it possible to create a Blueprint-friendly Burning Man experience?

Could blockchain-enabled devices / crypto-secured hardware be used to collect community feedback in a way that‚Äôs transparent and community-owned? **4.

What are you building!?** Nothing gets me more excited than other people‚Äôs passion to bring something into the world.

Broadly, I‚Äôm a pretty curious person.

I'm Uri, from Barcelona!

I quit tech (Chief of staff/Head of Community) after 5 years when I realised that I was not totally free to pursue my interests.

Since then I have been pretty much surrendered to what interests me, from starting my own business, to learning to code to writing plays.

Besides BCN, I've lived in Vietnam and NYC.

I love walking in the woods, reading, and watching films/series.

I always dreamt university would introduce me to like-minded people but it did not.

When I heard about NS I got excited.

I'm looking forward to getting inspired by you all, feeling quite dumb often about all the things I do not know, and having time to write and reflect far from home!

I currently freelance in ops/coding for startups and small companies, and build my own projects on the side.

I'm particularly interested in movie-making in the age of AI and short attention spans.

Looking forward to meeting you all!"

Can‚Äôt wait to join this experience I was born in the far north of Sweden, by the Arctic Circle.

Some say I‚Äôm half Viking half S√°mi.

I was never motivated by authority so I always found school quite boring.

I still went to university studying computer science and business for a dual degree.

It mostly felt like a waste though and I spent most time learning following my own curiosity.

Since then I started a digital agency building POC for startups, developed a titanium-based DJ headphone used by top DJs like Diplo and Skrillex, co-founded a record label, built a cabin village in the mountains and co-founded a technology company developing AI models for automating valuation of real estate assets and opening up single-family homes at scale as a new asset class for institutional investors.

Since my days in school I've been thinking about how demotivating the education system is.

Academia is killing creativity and the joy of learning with its assembly line methods.

I want to encourage students to dive straight into building at the edges of progress, without waiting for an academic diploma as a stamp of approval at the cost of your soul.

I‚Äôm exploring a medium combining crypto, digital art, animated video and gaming, infused with our deepest knowledge.

This is where my focus is now and Network States seems like the perfect place to apply it.

I like to read widely, produce (mostly electronic) music, design houses, take long walks and think about how the world works.

I‚Äôm always drawn to the intersection of art and technology and learning about the frontier of innovation in various fields.

My goal at NS is to meet like-minded people who want to replace dysfunctional institutions and build better environments for optimism to flourish.

Happy to connect with anyone who resonates and thank you <@777003807279677500> for making this happen.

Looking forward to meeting and learning from you all!"

I'm from London originally and have been moving around the world over the last few years, between Europe, Asia and America.

I'm coming to NS because I'm looking for a community with a vision.

I'm interested in future societies built to accommodate frontier technology like life extension, AGI, diverse intelligence and space exploration.

At a time when all this is on the horizon, the West feels increasingly negative and backward-looking, and I'm no longer convinced it is the right environment for these ideas to flourish.

Something new is needed to bring together people who still believe in the future, and I hope that NS can be the seed.

Work-wise, I'm interested in stories/media and how they influence what gets done in the world.

I'm a developer/designer hybrid, and I'm currently bootstrapping a new project in AI narrative media/simulations.

Before that, I started an online learning company and worked on a series of other consumer tech products.

I have some experience in crypto after working on an education DAO, and have degrees in biology and material science.

I also bought $BODEN once, so I guess that makes me an investor too?

I'm Bjoern from Germany, and really look forward to Network School.

I always was interested in libertarian principles and looking for a truly meritocratic, free community.

Back in 2015, I was one of the early visitors to Liberland, what should have been a new, libertarian micronation, but did not work out.

I first bought one Bitcoin in 2013 for ‚Ç¨100 in cash, back then I was looking for a privacy-focused way to pay online.

Back then it was just one option on a long list next to paysafecard, VCCs, and prepaid cards, but crypto quickly became something I really care about for freedom and state-resistance.

Today, I run Lendorse, a startup that helps finance talented but underprivileged students from developing and emerging countries to study STEM MSc programs in Europe.

There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, because I‚Äôve become increasingly skeptical about Europe's future.

I‚Äôm very interested in longevity.

I see death as the final enemy and find it crazy how indifferent society is to it.

I‚Äôve started my own ""Bryan light"" longevity protocol, with regular blood tests and various supplements, but I still struggle with sleep discipline and maintaining a good diet and hope for the peer pressure of the program.

Professionally, I studied economics and business at LSE and St.

Gallen.

After a couple of years at McKinsey, I left the corporate world and have been in the startup ecosystem ever since (TradFi & Logistics).

I probably arrive a few days late to network school (still sorting out my logistics), but I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting all of you soon!"

I'm Bj√∂rn, of Swedish origin as you might assume.

I spent most of my formative years in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Now, at 23 years old, I find myself living in Spain, which presents an interesting contrast to my background and beliefs. **|Current Projects|** **Building a decentralized water utility** I'm incredibly excited to be attending the network school with my partner.

Balaji's network state thesis is at the core of my startup's vision: I'm building a decentralized water utility for network states, currently focused on Latin America.

We aim to lower economic barriers to clean water access through reimagined core infrastructure and ownership models. (By the way, anyone have contacts in El Salvador? üòú) **EU/accelerationism podcast** Living in Spain is conflicting for me.

It's challenging being a pro-capitalist, small-government kind of guy in this environment.

However, I've channeled this challenge into action: 1.

I've established a substantial chapter of the EU/ACC movement through strong local business communities. 2.

I started a podcast where we stream on X/twitter Spaces, amplifying voices from a network of local live players.

We've already reached over 600 attendees in our first stream.

I tend to sway pessimistic about Europe's current trajectory, but I‚Äôm determined to spark honest conversations about it and empower live players who can actually make a change. **|Personal Interests|** While I enjoy fitness, music, and playing guitar, above ALL I find myself irresistibly drawn to the mysteries of ancient civilizations, a passion that permeates every aspect of my life and intellectual growth.

I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and continuing to work towards innovative solutions in both the digital and physical realms.

I'm 31 from Augusta GA.

Spent my adult life living in Atlanta, Austin, Antwerp, and currently Buenos Aires.

I studied computer science and chemistry at georgia tech, and did a finance masters in Belgium.

Some things that I enjoy doing: * Being physically active (I love kettlebell and bodyweight training) * Reading classic and nonfiction books * Researching investment ideas * Programming * Living in walkable cities Something interesting about me is I have a pilot‚Äôs license and come from a family of pilots.

I spent a good portion of my 20s at an IT consulting firm working on software projects at large companies and experienced the guts of corporate America.

In 2021, after feeling unfilfilled and alienated by the corporate culture, I resigned to focus on stock & crypto investing and tinkering with projects.

Fitness has been part of my life since I was 15.

I'm a kettlebell enthusiast.

I also want to try new forms of exercise while on the island, especially yoga and stretching because I have skipped that more or less ha.

I'm coming to NS because Balaji‚Äôs idea of a network state has always excited me.

The moment I saw his post about NS and read '""We got an island"" I applied ha.

My life - - In crypto since 2014, and always believe it‚Äôs not a game about money.

I agree with Balaji in so many ways especially when it comes to future of the humanity, but it might take so many years or even generations for things to start moving (I guess that‚Äôs why we are learning to live longer or simply don‚Äôt die in this school) - Did my undergrad in the US and learned English - Previously a journalist based in Washington D.C. reporting on world politics - Switched to producing/directing stand-up comedy shows in China.

Show biz in China is weirdly fun! - Now a full-time writer, also run a travel agency focusing on tours in South East Asia What I can provide to NS (just did a little brainstorming) - I make Chinese food and hot pot.

If food is too healthy in NS, I‚Äôll try to cook and share food.

Not sure if we‚Äôll have access to a decent kitchen, but we are close to a modern civilization (Singapore), so I‚Äôm sure we can figure something out - I take people to Bali all the time.

I‚Äôm like half a local, so if you need tips/recommendations, hey (waving hands) - I directed & produced quite a few stand-up shows, podcasts & talk shows.

I like talking to and interviewing people.

And here obviously we see so many interesting people with fantastic life stories - I read through everyone‚Äôs intro and already have so many questions to ask.

If you are also interested in producing something creative during your time in NS, let‚Äôs chat!

Happy to exchange ideas / collaborate - I‚Äôm writing a novel and one of the main characters is a crypto bro.

My name is Da aka Rida aka OctoQueenz (in Web3).

Born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand.

Eye-opening in the US, adulting in Canada, and reborn in the UAE.

I‚Äôve been living a nomadic life for the past couple of years, mostly between Dubai and Bangkok.

In 2013, I quit my corporate job as a Mechanical Engineer with $500 in my pocket to travel the world and ended up in Toronto.

That‚Äôs when I first heard about Bitcoin, and since then I got hooked and slid right into the rabbit hole.

Thanks to my degree, which is useless overseas, gave me the chance to explore and experiment with countless opportunities life has to offer, from waiting tables, bartending, real estate investing, and photography, to content creation and running my own restaurant, which got featured in multiple local Canadian media and became one of the top takeout spots in Toronto during the pandemic.

I lived in 6 different countries (soon to be 7 with Forest City!) across 4 continents and visited 65+ countries/territories.

I‚Äôve come to realize that no country is perfect, it‚Äôs only perfect for you at a specific time in your life and (almost) all governments are the same.

I‚Äôm heavily invested in Web3, starting with DeFi and then NFTs during the Pandemic.

Together with my husband (who will also be attending NS), we launched an indie gaming studio specializing in Metaverse games and are also building an online learning platform.

I‚Äôve been interested in longevity since 2019, when I first read Dr.

Sinclair‚Äôs Lifespan and have been using Bryan Johnson‚Äôs Blueprint products plus attending events like the VitaDAO DeSci Summit and the Akshay Summit in Dubai, where <@777003807279677500> was a speaker.

I remember thinking, ‚ÄúGreat events like this should be longer!‚Äù and here we are ‚ÄúThe Network School!‚Äù Super stoked to join Network School to create, connect, collaborate, and contribute with all of you who share the same values, vision, worldview, and excitement for life!"

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been deeply involved with Zafra Nature Reserve, a Colombian community initiative in eco-tourism, eco-education and bioregional regeneration.

From here I lead Natural Movement retreats for international participants, run MovNat teacher training certifications across the Americas, and maintain an online and in-person embodiment coaching practice.

I'm a software developer building a decentralized code collaboration platform for open source development with my longtime friend and co-founder, Parth (he is also part of the program).

I've always been fascinated by programming and its power to bring ideas to life.

It's much more accessible compared to other careers where specialized instruments or capital are required for research.

In comparison, we only need a laptop and an internet connection to conduct experiments; our ideas are the only limitation.

I started working with Parth in 2019.

I had just left my 3-year stint at a tech startup and was taking a break to learn about machine learning, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.

I still vividly remember the first time I sat down with Parth as he explained the concept behind cryptocurrencies and their practical applications, convincing me to work with him.

More than the financial and speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, I was excited about the power to create micro-economies and incentives that could easily mobilize people across the world to work towards common goals.

After that, we never looked back, and I've learned a lot both professionally and personally.

In recent years, I've also been practicing meditation and improving my lifestyle for better health and slower aging.

We have also been remotely working from Dubai, Bangkok and Banglore.

I am really excited after reading through all your intros and thrilled to be part of this program and exchange ideas with all of you.

I'm looking forward to lots of learning and making new friends."

So excited about this and meeting everyone!

I grew up in the early days of the internet with 28k dial up and was mesmerized by the online forums, games, and the world it unlocked.

I've been in the web3 space since around 2021 and have been coding since a young age.

Big fan of open-source and building in public.

Most recently I've been building funding platforms on Ethereum.

I recently started a part-time course in business development with a focus on sustainability.

I worked on a project that explored how the innovative funding mechanisms in blockchain ecosystems can be applied to humanitarian aid and funding of regenerative activities.

Just read the Innovators (Walter Isaacson) and inspired by the way it portrays innovation as a team activity powered by cross-disciplinary skills so I'm hoping to explore some collaborations and learning from each other.

I'm interested in expanding my skills in areas like AI, cryptography, digital governance, game theory, and applying them to today's challenges while keeping a keen eye on their future implications.

Also interested in healthy food, cooking, and wellness.

As for marketing, I used to do product marketing for apps - hit top 5 apps within SEA region in apple app stores.

Seeing so many gurus in sales and marketing (as well as other areas), we should not only organises lessons - we should probably have sessions where we can help each other projects! üî• Example: sessions where we have one person to share their projects and other people can share their knowledge or help out!

I‚Äôm Hugo Faz, performance artist and filmmaker originating from grassroots queer communities, long time cultural agitator, anti-censorship advocate and art collector based in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, fully involved with crypto and NFTs since early 2021.

The moment I read Balaji‚Äôs announcement of the Network School I knew I was meant to attend, even before reading the term ""latin-american libertarians""!

Since getting to know and aligning with punk6529‚Äôs vision for an open metaverse, I became fully invested ‚Äì time and money ‚Äì in building our decentralized future.

Not only I was one of the first Meme Artists to create for 6529‚Äôs project (https://seize.io/the-memes/30), I am also one of the biggest collectors of 6529's The Memes ‚Äî which have just been revealed as the fundamental building blocks for a practically functioning Network State ‚Äî and among the highest reputed members of their network (https://seize.io/hugofaz).

I have been collecting culturally relevant NFTs not just for myself but also for Casa NUA (https://en.nft.nua.casa), the southern hemisphere‚Äôs first permanent IRL Museum for Decentralized Art, which I founded in 2023 in the heart of S√£o Paulo, and which now holds regular exhibitions of art minted as NFTs, culturally educating a new generation of artists, collectors and enthusiasts.

But besides all of the above, the Burn pillar of NS hit me even harder.

Having my father diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease in 2015 got me since embarked on a personal journey to optimize my physical (and thus my brain‚Äôs) health and gain as much longevity as I can to keep building and seeing flourish our shared envisioned future of peace, freedom [to transact] and knowledge.

I have recently began using my social platform on Instagram (https://instagram.com/hugofaz) to share this health journey daily and inspire others to do the same for themselves, becoming a health and fitness influencer of sorts, while also relying on my follower community to discipline myself.

I follow Bryan Johnson‚Äôs achievements closely!

I‚Äôm Nate, an Americanüá∫üá∏/Kiwiüá≥üáø born in Hong Kong, my early childhood was based in China/New Zealand.

Middle/high school and uni were completed in the US, earning a bachelor's degree in nuclear physics.

Solo travel became one of my favorite hobbies, with adventures in ~30 countries.

My view on life is it‚Äôs the most realistic MMORPG, with each new location/role as the next level, full of trials to overcome.

Other hobbies include flying drones, reading, trading, hiking, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.

Artists and digital nomads influenced my philosophy about work and purpose, particularly around untethering oneself from a physical location while contributing to an aligned tribe.

As for work, I‚Äôve played different roles such as a medical imaging researcher, soul-sucking fortune 500 company intern, AP/IB science and math teacher at international schools, bizdev co-founder for a Xiaohongshu (Chinese Instagram) based travel agency, co-founder of a memecoin market/social analytics website, growth hacker at a Y Combinator backed startup, creator of a Zoom based web3 introductory course.

So far, I‚Äôve found education and building to be my most satisfying work.

A data-hungry scientist, educator, and adventurer is how I best describe myself.

I work to apply the scientific method to my life from diet and exercise to learning and relationships.

I‚Äôm passionate about education, applications of decentralized blockchain tech, health/longevity, AI, self-determination, community building, self-custody, and freedom.

Recently I‚Äôve been doing some soul searching about how to spend my time and energy.

When I read <@777003807279677500> post about the Network School, my hair stood up.

It gave me a wonderful sense of inspiration and in that moment, I **KNEW** it was exactly what I needed to be a part of, in any shape or form.

My goals for it are to learn/burn/earn, network, improve my sleep routine, share my skills, and become a founding member of the Network State."

As a multiple-time founder, I've lived the now-famous saying: 'First-time founders are obsessed with product, second-time founders are obsessed with distribution.' I find myself grappling with distribution challenges frequently.

While I'm excited about collaborating to enhance technical skills (count me in for AI coding bootcamps <@940285043199320154><@903572509125906442> <@238393956747051011> <@816005819287994378> <@171355535990456320> <@668584127552946181> <@1276471200666746942>), I'm equally eager to engage in discussions about distribution strategies, success stories, and strategies for the future.

Excited to be here!

I was born and raised in a tiny village in the French countryside.

From the age of 10, I immersed myself in books daily.

At 14, I formed a group of friends around skateboarding.

Together, we financed and constructed a skatepark in our village.

This early taste of community building and bringing an idea to life fueled my ambitions.

At 19, I created a YouTube channel called 'People Of'.

It quickly gained traction in the music scene, generating millions of views every month.

It allowed me to earn my first internet money, empowering me to drop out of law school in Bordeaux and relocate to Paris.

At 21, I began exploring Augmented Reality, creating AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat.

My Instagram filters rapidly made half a billion views.

Facebook (now Meta) invited me to their London HQ.

There, I connected with fellow creators and the Facebook team behind the Spark AR software, further expanding my horizons.

Currently, I'm passionate about 3D filmmaking in real-time, a cutting-edge technique using the power of Unreal Engine 5.

This technology allows for near-instantaneous 3D rendering (unlike traditional 3D softwares that demands huge rendering time or access to costly render farms).

I believe we're on the edge of a paradigm shift, where small teams can create cinematic experiences capable of captivating millions while generating significant revenue.

This is where I'm now focusing my energy, alongside my interests in AI, cryptocurrency, and philosophy.

I grew up soaking in the vibrant culture of Goa, and my adventures have taken me all over‚Äîfrom bustling cities across India to living and working in multicultural Singapore, studying on a beautiful island in Canada, and reconnecting with my roots through yoga & Ayurveda in the foothills of the Himalayas while training staff at a leading wellness resort.

Along the way, I met my husband, Rajat, and together, we've been on a journey to find inspiring communities, from the varied landscapes of India & Nepal, to the hinterlands of Portugal, cosmopolitan Dubai and tropical Southeast Asia.

Rajat introduced me to the world of web3.

For us, being part of the Network School is an incredible opportunity for learning, growing, and collaborating, and we are excited to be a part of this revolutionary community.

My background is all about connecting with people and exploring new ideas: - Hospitality & Training: I‚Äôve worked in airlines and hotels, where I learned the art of creating meaningful experiences and embracing diverse cultures.

As a Cultural Awareness Trainer with Singapore Airlines, I developed a deep appreciation for cross-cultural communication. - Wellbeing & Yoga: I‚Äôve completed a couple of yoga teacher trainings and enjoy blending ancient practices with modern living. - Creativity: I‚Äôm also exploring my creative side through jewelry design (using Procreate), web3, crypto, and digital art‚Äîstill new to these, but eager to dive in.

I recently completed my masters and wrote my thesis on ‚ÄòEstablishing And Growing Web3-Enabled Fashion Brands For The Indian Diaspora‚Äô.

Can‚Äôt wait to connect, grow and collaborate with everyone here.

Looking forward to meeting all of you and being part of this amazing journey."

I'm Kirina, an investor currently setting up my own business.

I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and I'm thrilled to be living in Singapore, a global financial hub.

Growing up in Japan, I realized that Japanese IPs like Pok√©mon and Hello Kitty have had a huge influence worldwide.

However, I believe it's time for new ideas.

My vision is to empower young IP creators by providing liquidity to the IP market.

Currently, I work part-time as an investment manager for a Web3 accelerator in Japan.

IRL, I go by the name of Shabbir Haider.

I'm the founder of Futurelab Studios (https://futurelabstudios.com/) - where I follow a community-centric, quest-based approach to make AI accessible to all - prioritizing low-income youth and social impact organizations. _My goal is to ensure an even distribution of the future and enable abundance for all._ I love reading (1. scifi

2. everything under the sun, in that order) and can often be found setting up book clubs.

I love meditating, have been to Vipassana twice and am honestly taken aback at the high frequency its being mentioned here. (surreal, indeed) Most of all though - I love dreaming: - About a kind and abundant world, free from diseases, suffering and limitations. - A world where we get to call the entire Universe, and not just this one lone planet, our Home.

I believe we all have the unique privilege to get to build this dream into a concrete reality - in our own lifetime. _ _P.S.

Super excited to be here!

I cannot believe this is happening.

Balaji is my online guru and one of my heroes in crypto.

The moment I saw this opportunity on twitter, I just jumped on it.

Before this, I wanted to go to Singapore for Breakpoint and Network conference just to see Balaji but this opportunity has taken things to next level where I can learn directly from the GURU himself!.

Super pumped up üôÇ My name is Ramakanth.

I am from India but living in Dubai for the last 3 years.

Did my Bachelors in IT from India and then my MBA from Canada.

Worked in Canada for 9 years but always wanted to get out of a 9 to 5 job and gain my financial freedom.

Tried quite a few things such as mobile app development, e-book writing, stock trading, sports betting etc. but nothing worked out.

Then I found crypto in Crypto in 2016 and from then on never looked back.

Thanks to the bull run in 2021, I could save some money (enough to quit my regular job) and leave Canada.

Have been in Dubai since 2021 and waiting for the next bull market to liquidate enough of my portfolio to gain financial freedom and move back to India permanently.

Lucky enough to be an early investor in projects such as Graph, Solana, Helium, Livepeer, Stacks etc.

Full time crypto investor right now.

Loving this independence and cannot think of working a 9 to 5 ever again.

Reading, Playing Cricket and Badminton, watching movies have been my hobbies lately.

Trying out Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol for the last 2 months now.

Seeing some good results and it would be interesting to meet Bryan directly and learn from him.

I am super excited to meet you all talented people out there and learn, burn and earn along with you guys.

Time to apply for those visas!

My name is Rajat(https://x.com/r_k_luthra), Me & my wife Neha, are deeply honoured to be joining the Network School amongst all you rockstars.

I have a background in the jewelry industry in India as a designer/entrepreneur.

Last year, I was introduced to Farcaster, and since then, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to design for several web3 communities.

I‚Äôve found a deep connection with some, like Nouns Dao, where I‚Äôm currently building jewelry collections & developing a Nounish jewelry brand that integrates their various communities.

I‚Äôm also working on a transmedia storytelling brand that spans a novel series, films, a jewelry brand, and games.

My aspiration is to empower people by gamifying spiritual & martial arts techniques from diverse cultures worldwide, using emerging technologies like AR/VR.

I‚Äôm pursuing programs in game design, AI filmmaking and film editing, at the side, to be a creator in these emerging mediums.

I‚Äôm excited to see meditators here, I have had experiences with a few techniques.

I‚Äôve also trained in multiple martial arts like Capoeira, BJJ, Krav Maga, etc. and have been passionate about CrossFit.

Would love to explore training & meditating together.

My life has been a quest for community‚Äîa sangha, as Buddha would say‚Äîa group of like-minded souls united by a shared purpose & now to be part of this cohort feels surreal.

From running 90 day hackathons across writing, fitness, spirituality, startups, with two friends some years back, to actually being part of the most interesting 90 day cohort on the planet, under a teacher and visionary like Balaji, I‚Äôm in awe of how life can sometimes answer your deepest dreams.

Thanks <@777003807279677500> for dreaming this dream, for manifesting this dream & for selecting a ‚Äòdark talent‚Äô like me.

I have strong skills in marketing campaigns and community growth and have worked for some of the top blockchain projects before.

I love experiencing new protocols and new projects and getting involved in all the new trending narratives!

I've had the pleasure of using, buying, and researching thousands of crypto projects!

They cover a whole range of areas, from DeFi, NFT, gaming, and social dApps to AI, DePin, memecoins, and various new blockchains.

I am an individual investor now and enjoy communicating thoughts on the market and all the exciting new projects with friends.

I'm currently working on a tool that will assess the capabilities of crypto KOLs and assist retail users in making more informed investment decisions.

I'm not an experienced developer, but I'm learning fast with the help of AI!

I'm in my late 20s, I view myself as very libertarian / cypherpunk and vibing with that type of people is what got me in crypto a while ago.

I learned to code in a p2p school (42) where there was no teacher, the building was open 24/7, there was a skilltree of project with branches depending what area of computer science you want to explore and you got graded by other students and the school test scripts.

I've also a deep passion for economy, I think I have more than 10k hours trying to figure out how the system works but I still have a lot to figure out In crypto right now I focus on the solana ecosystem.

I've contributed with my girlfriend to metadao, the futarchy experiment on solana that's doing great and we hacked a mobile app for the last colosseum hackathon that let you challenge yourself / your friends to do stuff for example build in public or tweet more often etc ... and you get slash if you don't do it.

And after seeing so many like-minded people here, I thought I'll do it now My name is Parth (30 years old), I am from India originally.

I started my journey by dropping out of college and searching my path.

I love technology and did freelancing for a long time before entering crypto.

I ran a service company for a while before building a decentralized Github.

As AI is changing everything, I am working on another challenging idea that builds on top of it.

I love dogs and had a German shepherd for 10 years (passed away last year).

He was something that grounded me in India so after that, I moved to wherever opportunities took me.

I stay between India, Thailand and Dubai now.

I love that so many people here are into meditation, it‚Äôs amazing.

Meditation changed my life.

I started from the Vipassana retreat in Koh Phangan, thailand where I got my first experience which I couldn‚Äôt give words to and got hooked immediately.

Post that I spent 8 months meditating in a retreat in India while working remotely.

This restructured my understanding of spirituality and awareness.

I have also dabbed with longevity (food, medicines and fasting) and seen dramatic changes that the body and mind have when done strictly.

Network School is an amazing opportunity and I intend to make the most of it.

So anyone here needs some guidance/help in technology, development, crypto, or AI, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

Meanwhile, I definitely need help with marketing myself and what I build (I feel I am not so great at it) and also working out( I have never been a regular gym goer) I understand that we all are here because we are all risk-takers who are not afraid to try something new.

I feel that this experience will be transformative for each one of us.

I am excited to be around such a talented bunch of people and would love to talk and network with everyone here and learn from their journey.

Cannot wait for this to begin."

I‚Äôm a DeFi power user.

I‚Äôm all about using cutting-edge onchain apps & infrastructure, understanding DeFi on a deep level, and educating others.

Since 2021 (just after defi summer), I‚Äôve been very active onchain.

The onchain economy was growing, so I left my big4 IT Risk job and joined a venture capital syndicate investing in early stage DeFi projects.

I built relationships with many of our LPs & became their go-to for everything onchain.

When the venture syndicate wound down, I doubled down on DeFi and built a company selling research.

We covered projects like Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Aave, Maker, GMX, Jupiter, Curve, and more.

Recently, I‚Äôve stepped back from that company, and my gf and I have been digital-nomad style traveling in SE Asia.

Skills I‚Äôm leveling up at NS (**learn**):

1. **Onchain data analysis**.

Extracting insights from onchain data.

2. **Financial analysis**.

Building financial models for digital assets.

3. **Programming**.

Building onchain apps, ensuring security, and plugging onchain data into financial models.

4. **Systems Design**.

Building sustainable, secure, and scalable onchain apps that minimize/eliminate governance risk.

5. **Content creation**.

Providing value beyond my existing client base, promoting NS builders and community members to the broader world, and helping educate others at scale to reduce onchain fraud, theft, and malinvestment.

My favorite **burn** activities are weightlifting and Muay Thai.

To anyone here who is not an onchain power users or developer: If you have any questions or want practical blockchain/DeFi knowledge feel free to reach out, tag me, or DM.

I love being useful to anyone who wants to use** onchain apps**.

There is no question to basic or silly.

I‚Äôm 26yrs old.

Born in Louisiana, raised in Alabama (rural states in the Southern USA üá∫üá∏ ).

Humbled to be here.

I‚Äôm in Da Nang, Vietnam until the NS starts.

My name is Esther, I‚Äôm a 30 year old from the Netherlands.

My background is in international law, I‚Äôve studied both human rights law and tax law.

Currently I‚Äôm working for a small international bank from the Netherlands where I am an international tax manager, mainly involved with the investment fund side of our company.

However, I‚Äôm looking to change my career to something else, although I‚Äôm not yet quite sure what exactly.

It is also still unclear whether I can continue this job remote, so I might have to quit (please tell me I‚Äôm not crazy) which I‚Äôll then see as the trigger to actually start something else.

On that note, I‚Äôve been learning to program, but I‚Äôm still on a very beginner level.

I am also interested in anything crypto, AI and web3, I‚Äôm definitely not an expert yet but I‚Äôve already learned quite a bit of the basics from my partner (who will join the NS as well!), and looking forward to keep learning about all this at the NS.

Outside of the work sphere I love travelling (just spend 6 months in South America), playing board games, learning new things, and I am a health enthusiast, following Blueprint for a while now.

Working out has been a constant throughout my life ‚Äì from playing field hockey on a decent level, to running several marathons, to doing multiple day hikes.

Anything active and I‚Äôm in!

At the Network School I am hoping to meet amazing people, learn a lot, exchange thoughts, get fit and hopefully find a new career path."

Honoured to be a part of this with all of YOU.

First business at 16.

Failed 5 times before my first success in the Web3 Space as a project founder.

Worked on building a game and eventually failed due to my own lack of technical knowledge necessary.

Of course, all of these are not failures but huge learning lessons.

Did consultancy & advisory for several firms before exploring the world of angel investing & venture capital.

I love building businesses that bring huge value.

Big believer in the future of crypto & web3. **My Goal** for entering the Network School to **learn**, **build new relationships** and **earn**.

I'm in a stage in my life where my sole goal is to level up.

To surround myself with the brightest minds and brainstorm then execute huge ideas.

I'm in a bit of a lull period where I'm preparing myself for the next crazy venture/business in my life.

I love creating content, and I will create a ""Network State Journey"" series documenting our daily lives, activities and experiences. **Fellow content creators** or those interested to start can absolutely join along on the ride here - just pm me.

Anyone looking to start their next big venture/business, I look forward to meeting and brainstorming.

I intend to form an A* Team with those at the NS.

Key interests: - I love animals and dogs.

Big dog lovers, can meet Butter, my big labrador, on a weekend trip to Singapore. - Reading, Nature, outdoors, fishing, camping, water-sports, outdoor survival, boxing, gym, biohacking, Trading.

On introductions, I‚Äôm Jim, Chinese-American currently raising two kids in Manila, Philippines (in this volatile region here, on nearly weekly basis, there could erupt nationalistic and cold-war-like flashpoints for potential escalation into wider Indo-Pacific conflict in terms of worst case scenario.

The Philippines is cursed to be in the ‚ÄúBermuda Triange‚Äù between South China Sea Spratlys Islands, Island of Taiwan, and Island of Guam).

I'm here to learn from everyone for the sake of my kids and their generation.

I hope my young sons eventually become future TNS Netizens and eventually thrive in new ecosystems that promise a more open, less fragmented, and less antagonistic future ‚Äî in which one doesn't have to be restricted by nation-state defined systems as ‚Äúother‚Äù, ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù, or ‚Äúthreat to XYZ‚Äú because one holds different passport.

I‚Äôm disturbed at how potentially dangerous a junction we are in right now relative to macro history arcs, with the currently sparring Western-order establishment (e.g.

G7) versus emerging non-Western (e.g.

BRICS) forces.

I am appreciative of the network state/network society movement‚Äôs potential to explore more peaceful, independent ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù paradigms that could, to borrow words of Balaji, engage enterprising Americans, tech progressive Indians, global Chinese, forward looking Europeans and Latin Americans, and aspiring builders from Africa, SE Asia and other Global South areas all together.

Places like Singapore would also benefit from more peace and tech globalism amid all the drums of decoupling and war.

My design methodology is influenced by my passion for gaming.

I grew up with J-Pop, RPGs, and animation.

In the gaming world, I used to create guilds and fight my way to be the top guild on the game server, all while providing a nurturing environment for my guild members.

I have launched my own Web3 platform since 2023, with operations in Tokyo and Singapore.

Our vision is to recreate the ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù concept of making the real world a game through DAO, AI, and gamification tools.

My goal here is to use these 3 months to train at a physical and mental level, focus more on product development, and find new party who share the same passion to explore and build the world together.

P.S.

I practice mediation, Previously attended Vipassana 10-day meditation camp in Myanmar and Kyoto.

So, aside from gaming, if you are also into meditation or interested in it, feel free to connect!"

I'm Colton, a jack of all trades mechanical engineer working in the HVAC/Plumbing side of the construction industry in the SF Bay area.

Stoked to meet you all and connect!

I've been playing with an idea similar to The Network State based on the idea of creating and decentralizing open-source blueprints for factories (ideally employee owned) that would manufacture (as autonomously as possible) products that would themselves automate (as much as possible) the handling of people's needs.

The idea being to give people on the ground the tools to come together and build the infrastructure to take care of themselves.

Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the foundational level covers Food, Water, & Shelter.

Then beyond that level: Health, Education, and Security.

So for example the solution set for ""shelter"" could look like a blueprint for a factory that cranks out unfolding shipping container houses.

My hobbies/interests include music (guitar, piano), travel (spent two years in Asia), amateur ancient history, survival skills, philosophy, spirituality, amateur biology, etc.

I don't know nearly enough about actually using the Blockchain, but I definitely appreciate a number of its potentials and can't wait to learn all about it.

Similarly excited to learn about web3, AI, etc.

The construction industry is a little old school with respect to remote work, so I'll only be able to attend for the first couple of weeks but I'm hoping to form some lasting connections and collaborations!"

My name is Sterlin.

I am a crypto OG.

I have been working professionally in the industry since 2015.

I got into crypto after being arrested back in 2009 for possession of MDMA.

This turned out to be a formative experience.

It taught me that the State is a wholly corrupted and debauched, and things need immediate overhaul.

It was this path that led me down an online rabbit hole.

Sometime in 2013 I came into contact with people calling themselves ""cypherpunks."" Those circles introduced me to bitcoin, and we were off to the races.

In this sense, I came into the space as an activist.

I wanted --- and still want --- to leverage crypto as a means for personal liberation and societal change.

I have had the opportunity to work directly with people like Roger Ver.

I was with bitcoin.com as a news writer, opinion page editor, and communications lead.

Then I worked in risk management for an OTC trading desk called Cryptospace.

And now I am working in the Network State ecosystem with Logos as a communications professional and writer for a year already.

I have spoken at dozens of cryptocurrency / tech conferences, have worked with some of the top players in the space, and seen unimaginable things.

I also wrote and published a book called ""Dignity & Decency: Rhapsodic Musings of a Modern Anarchist."" My wife and I have no children and are quasi-digitally nomadic.

I am here because I believe the network state is the path to realizing the vision of a more liberated humanity.

I cannot wait to meet you all, continue our shared education, and help enlighten the denizens of this planet for the sake of our future.

Our posterity counts on it."

I'm Andrew.

I'm an ethical hacker, cybersecurity consultant and crypto enthusiast.

I stack sats and I run nodes for several projects.

The last few years I've been a full-time digital nomad, traveling between Chile, Peru, El Salvador and Mexico.

I'm anxious to begin the Asia part of my tour.

I'd like to help establish a blockchain security wing for the cybersecurity company that I work with the most.

I don't know enough about blockchain security and I hope to learn it here from some of you others. (There may be employment opportunity for you here even).

I'm also open to working with any startups on their overall cybersecurity practice.

It's also my dream to someday make a set of interconnected games on the blockchain, where the progress and outcomes of one game has ripple effects on the other games, where objects, characters and skills can be transferred back and forth, and ultimately where players can create a marketplace of mods and get paid directly by their fans for their work.

I'm a member of Neo Tokyo DAO, but with all my competing priorities, the video games part of my life always falls to the bottom.

I am so excited to meet all of you!"

I discovered Balaji's 1729 community after leaving big tech out of boredom, and it's been life-changing.

Since then, I've been deep in crypto, currently working at Flashbots, where we solve MEV problems and build Ethereum infrastructure like MEV-Boost.

We're also exploring hardware-based solutions like TEE for credible and confidential computing (same tech used for Apple Intelligence).

On the side, I invest in and advise startups and funds in the space.

My Network School goal is to step back and refocus on the big questions.

I'm at a ""mid-life crisis"" point as a crypto builder, seeing how much of the space has drifted from the original crypto spirit.

Some key concerns I have include: 1.

Centralization Creep: Growing influence of institutional players (e.g., ETFs) potentially centralizing power and increasing vulnerability to attacks. 2.

Speculative Casino Culture: Influx of opportunists and scammers across all levels, turning the industry into a speculative playground‚Äîwhere the yield/return comes from. 3.

Self-Regulation Failure: Industry's struggle to self-regulate and prevent bad actors from hijacking the movement, exposing limitations of libertarian ideals. 4.

Hype Over Substance: Prevalence of shallow, overhyped projects optimized for impressing retails and quick exits rather than creating real impact or sustainable business/protocol, fostering a culture of pseudo-profound but ultimately meaningless innovations.

Balaji's clear big-picture thinking was what I loved most about

1729. (I often joke he's our era's Hari Seldon, while I'm still the clueless encyclopedist ‚Äì Foundation fans will get it.) I'm here to: 1.

Find my own answers to the big questions about crypto as an industry and movement 2.

Get a clearer picture of our current world 3.

Gain more clarity and conviction for my future path Excited to embark on this journey with you all ‚Äì can't wait to learn from you, have fun, and tackle these challenges together!"
