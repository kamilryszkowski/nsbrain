I‚Äôve been all over the place: startups, crypto, marketing, business, and even coliving.

Now I‚Äôm focused on full-stack development (more like vibe coding these days) and building my own products.

I built honeyvoice.app and am now working on mento.blog, a blog platform optimized for SEO with AI mentor features.

Being a solopreneur has been tough, and last year, I hit major burnout.

Funny enough, what got me out of it was yoga teacher training in Bali.

It helped me reset and gave me a fresh perspective.

Now I‚Äôm a certified yoga teacher, and maybe I‚Äôll share some of what I‚Äôve learned at NS.

Maybe even find a teammate or co-founder.

Here's where to find us: https://medium.com/@merito.network and https://x.com/MeritoNetwork ] Can't wait to hit the Burn gym with NS friends.

Have taught weight lifting to dozens of friends and enjoy finding longevity hacks.

I‚Äôm Billy Jo, from S.Korea.

I went to high school in Australia, then studied Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, mixing AI and philosophy.

In college, I learned that I‚Äôm better at explaining tech than coding, which later led to my [YouTube](http://youtube.com/@bjunjo) and [Substack](https://billyjo.substack.com/).

Career-wise, I started as a business development rep, then worked as a data analyst at [Gong](http://gong.io) in Silicon Valley, digging into sales data and linking tech with clients.

Did BD role again briefly, launched my content platforms with a decent following on Bitcoin and AI, then joined [Antler Korea](https://www.antler.co/location/korea) as a Founder-in-Residence, securing some government grants.

Now, I‚Äôm learning how to angel investing with [Lightning Ventures](https://ltng.ventures) syndicate.

I joined NS to figure out why and how to run my own fund‚Äîinvesting in Bitcoin startups, robot (or deep tech) startups, El Salvador fixed-income bonds, and Bitcoin treasury company bonds/warrants as an institutional investor.

Why?

To back systems and tech that shift how things work.

How?

I‚Äôd love your ideas on structuring it and finding the right moves.

Excited to connect and swap thoughts!

Super excited to be here!

I‚Äôm Harsh from Jaipur, India, and I'm joining NS today, March 1st!

I‚Äôve been building software for the past six years, mostly helping early-stage startups get their MVPs off the ground and setting up their tech stacks.

I‚Äôve also been a founding engineer at a couple of startups, and until recently, I was at a YC company‚Äîdecided it was time to move on and finally build something of my own.

I‚Äôve been in the crypto space since 2015 and genuinely believe Bitcoin should be the currency of the future.

Fun fact: I actually met Balaji in 2022 at the Singapore Fintech Festival!

When he first tweeted last year, ‚ÄúWe got an island,‚Äù I knew I had to be part of this and applied right away.

Really looking forward to meeting like-minded folks, exchanging ideas, and diving into all the events‚Äîespecially hackathons (won a few in the past, so definitely up for the challenge!).

I was born and raised in Mexico City, but my family‚Äôs originally from India.

I studied CS + math finance at Carnegie Mellon, then worked at Meta, Palantir and spent the last few years building a DeFi borrow/lend aggregator.

Now I‚Äôm starting a new company building hashrate perps to help Bitcoin miners stabilize their revenue.

My family‚Äôs had a history of forced exits due to persecution after changes in government, which is what originally got me excited about Bitcoin and is now getting me very excited about the network school.

Joining NS on March 1!

Chinese-American, studied cognitive science at UC Berkeley.

Explored tech in Silicon Valley (VR/AR, 3D printing, crypto, maker culture).

Currently traveling Southeast Asia after two years in Mexico City.

My work spans education (built makerspaces for 10,000+ high schoolers in Peru/Colombia), health (co-founded IBDCoach), crypto (community strategy @ web3 venture studio and protocols), and now AI.

For the last three years, I've focused entirely on AI‚Äîbuilding and deploying ideas quickly.

Currently building Speak To Earn to empower native speakers from low-resource communities, helping create AI that reflects humanity's linguistic diversity.

Recently won two first place prizes at the Safe Agentathon (https://devfolio.co/projects/yapper-9cfd).

I think deeply about starting conditions for products, communities, and societal transformation.

At scale, startup societies are an alignment problem‚Äîbringing the right people together around shared values.

My time living in Mexico for two years has shown me how communities form around values rather than geography.

This journey led me to Network School, where I hope to find high agency, creative people to collaborate with.

I spend most of my time vibe coding with AI and focusing on my health and meditating.

Core values: Freedom, Growth, Connection.

Interests: AI, crypto, vibe coding, frontier / startup societies, human-ai collaboration / intelligence augmentation, speaking new languages, future of user interfaces, history, philosophy.

Currently studying with Math Academy to dive deeper into AI/ML.

Hobbies: FOOD (ran a 900-person foodies group in CDMX), boxing, AI art, music. https://x.com/thealexyao Looking forward to meeting and connecting with everyone!",discord

I‚Äôm Gabi, and I‚Äôll be arriving with my husband and our sons on April 1st (my husband, <@501503366350766116> , has already introduced himself above). ü•≥ I was born in Budapest, Hungaryüá≠üá∫ , but I also lived in Mexico üá≤üáΩ and Brazil üáßüá∑ as a child.

For the past three years, we‚Äôve been living in Bali. üå¥ Originally, I trained as a lawyer and worked in television before having kids, mainly in international program acquisitions.

Then, in 2013, my husband founded MrCoin, Hungary‚Äôs first Bitcoin exchange, and I was involved in that journey as well. <:bitcoin:1282286965794017280> It was incredibly exciting to introduce the then-unknown concept of Bitcoin to Hungary and to help build and educate the community around it.

We organized Bitcoin film festivals, gave talks, and produced the Bitcoin segment for Hungary‚Äôs most well-known financial radio show weekly for many years.

One of the highlights of this journey was unveiling the world‚Äôs first Satoshi statue in Budapest, which has since become a global symbol of Satoshi.

We‚Äôre very proud of that!

Fun fact: the statue was originally planned to have a hat, I was the one who convinced the team that the statue absolutely had to have a hood. üôÉ .

I‚Äôm not a tech person by nature ‚Äî I‚Äôm more interested in how technology and society influence each other.

This applies to both cryptocurrencies and AI.

I‚Äôm not so much focused on what happens at the code level, but rather how these innovations can be used for the benefit of humanity, maximizing their positive impact while minimizing potential risks. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚òÆÔ∏è ü´Ç I have a deep passion for working with children. üíó üö∏ As a UNICEF volunteer for years, I helped run interactive workshops on children's rights and the realities of kids living in different parts of the world.

I‚Äôm a Third Culture Kid (TCK), and my sons are as well, so I have extensive experience‚Äîboth as a former TCK myself and now as a parent‚Äîon what it means to grow up across multiple countries.

I understand the advantages and challenges of this lifestyle and how to enhance the positives while mitigating the difficulties.

I even wrote a children's book on this topic, which won the ""Children‚Äôs Book of the Year"" award in Hungary in 2024.

Additionally, I run educational Facebook groups in Hungary on topics like TCK kids, as well as women and AI.

I am the co-founder of an indie book publishing company in Hungary called Zazie Books.

Beyond this, I have a background in journalism, political analysis, mediation, and coaching.

I‚Äôm currently furthering my education to specialize in coaching children as well. üë©‚Äçüéì My father was a member of Hungary‚Äôs first freely elected government after the fall of the communist regime, which gave me a deep insight from a young age into how a traditional nation-state operates.

This, along with my legal background, makes it fascinating for me to rethink the role and function of the state from the ground up.

This is one reason why I find NS so exciting.

My husband and I also share a goal of creating a space, school, and workshops for the children of NS residents ‚Äî ensuring they can grow and evolve alongside the adults.

After all, while we‚Äôre trying to figure out what the future will look like, they are the ones who will live in it the longest, so I believe it's essential to involve them in shaping it. üöÄ I have no harmful addictions‚Äîunless you count books, movies, and contemporary art and architecture... üòä I‚Äôm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and would love to chat and exchange ideas on any of these topics.

See you soon! üôÇ üòç",discord

Programming the new earth / heaven on earth economy.

I moved to silicon valley when it was cool, at Apple ATG initially, later some startups, then left before it became uncool, was a digital nomad in Thailand, living the dream, mountain villa, wife, 2 kids, car - then ended up taking 3 years off on a spiritual path, sat with teachers and Gurus, became determined to reach enlightenment, meditated, found the most direct teachings, ended up in Bali without the ex-wife but with the kids which was / is epic, they are the best üòâ One day, I became aware of reality - and that was enough for me and I got the message, back to work now!

The next day, I was hired as CTO of an ICO play - it fell apart quickly, but I learned a lot.

Then I worked on Seeds and Hypha DAO, a conscious currency and a DAO platform.

I am very much interested in the idea of network state; it is very clear to me that society is collapsing, not fit for a new state of consciousness emerging on earth, and the vision was always to build the new earth instead of fighting the old.

Been on this journey for 6 years now - it's going to happen.

Burning man was my inspiration for what an utopian society can look like - everyone volunteers, everyone does what they like to do, and everything gets done synchronistically.

A giving economy.

But before we get there on a large scale and in the real world, blockchain is our bridge - to get out of the money slave system and create peace on earth.

Any currency that's not corrupted basically would do - but blockchain is a technology that just so happens to fit the bill.

I‚Äôm Andre, I‚Äôll be joining TNS in April.

Currently based in New York.

About me ‚Äî I enjoy being at the frontier of new technology and exploring the ways that technology and society interact.

Over the years, I‚Äôve been an investor and have built several projects in the crypto space.

A few things I‚Äôm proud of: - Launched a protocol to use Bitcoin in smart contracts, currently with $100M+ in value locked - Was an early employee at the company that invented the first use of zero knowledge proofs (which are now widely used to create privacy-preserving and scalable systems) - Worked with governments around the US to research how crypto can create better systems and empower communities. - Built a financial literacy program to introduce New York students to the crypto industry.

While I‚Äôm at TNS, I‚Äôd love to work on building a platform for a Bitcoin-aligned network state.

I believe a society built around sound money enables humanity to flourish and this is now possible through advancements in layer 2 technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy strength training, biking, yoga, hiking, reading, learning, cooking.

I‚Äôm Michael Wang from Chengdu, China, but my journey has taken me far beyond my hometown.

I completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Melbourne, Australia, and over the past eight years, I‚Äôve been fully immersed in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

As a serial entrepreneur in this space, I‚Äôve had the privilege of building innovative projects from the ground up, navigating the highs and lows of this dynamic industry.

Alongside my entrepreneurial ventures, I‚Äôve also been an active investor in the crypto space, always on the lookout for groundbreaking opportunities.

I‚Äôm thrilled to have joined Network School in March, and I‚Äôm deeply inspired by Balaji‚Äôs visionary concept of the Network State.

I believe this idea has the potential to reshape the way we approach entrepreneurship, community-building, and innovation.

It‚Äôs exciting to think about how we can apply these principles to create something truly impactful.

For me, entrepreneurship is all about turning ideas into reality‚Äîtaking a concept from 0 to 1.

It‚Äôs about solving real problems, challenging the status quo, and creating value for others.

I‚Äôve learned that success in this space requires resilience, creativity, and a willingness to learn from failures.

I‚Äôd love to collaborate with like-minded individuals here to co-create, experiment, and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

At Network School, I‚Äôm looking forward to embracing the ""Learn, Burn, Earn, and Fun"" mindset.

Amiee here!

I‚Äôll be joining Network School on April 1st and super excited to be here!

I just graduated from the University of Sydney and had worked as an ESG Analyst in Sydney and as a Private Equity Analyst in Shenzhen.

Now, I‚Äôm focused on launching my own Tibetan incense brand and connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.

I‚Äôm also deeply passionate about yoga and Vipassana meditation, which have been transformative to me.

Vipassana is a technique that helps bring the unconscious mind to the surface.

As Goenka said, there are three kinds of thoughts: one is like ripples on the water, fleeting and temporary; another like a line drawn on the sand, easily washed away by the waves.

But the third is an imprint carved into stone, lasting through time.

This third kind is what‚Äôs stored deep in the iceberg of our unconscious mind, secretly influencing our behaviors‚Äîwhat we often call fate.

Practicing Vipassana has been the greatest gift of the past year, and I hope to share this experience with others.

Also!

I‚Äôll be in Mt.

Gambier for a Deep Week to get my Wave 2 certification, so I‚Äôll be in Sydney/Melbourne from March 12-24.

Catch me for a coffee if you're around!

If you're traveling via Singapore, you'll need to go through another visa process.

If that's not an issue, SIN is a good option since it's closer to Forest City.

Otherwise, you can fly to Kuala Lumpur, take a flight from there to Senai, and then a cab to Forest City.

If you're in a neighboring country like Indonesia or Thailand, you might find direct flights to Senai, which could be another option.",discord

We‚Äôre a fast-growing startup that‚Äôs revolutionizing the job search process with AI and Machine Learning‚Äîalready @ 7 figures in revenue profitably in just a few years & growing quickly.

We‚Äôre looking for a Chief of Staff for a high-impact, cross-functional role working across marketing, sales, product, and engineering.

This isn‚Äôt just an operational role; it‚Äôs a launchpad to a COO position at a company that‚Äôs already changing lives‚Äîhelping job seekers land $50K+ salary bumps and even double their income.

Why this role is exciting: üî• Work directly with a Columbia-educated, ex-McKinsey founder who has sourced deals for investors behind Netflix, Tinder, and AngelList üìà Scale an already successful cold email system from 50K to 100K+ weekly emails üí∞ Help optimize tens of thousands of job applications per month to increase conversion rates and revenue üöÄ Fast-paced, high-growth environment with a clear path to COO üí° Work with AI, automation, and cutting-edge growth strategies Super open to having you work remotely, but there‚Äôs potential for relocation as the company scales.

Compensation includes a significant commission-based component, ideal for someone hungry to grow and directly impact the company‚Äôs success & join me and my other business partners as we scale.

This doesn‚Äôt need experience, just RAW IQ, horsepower, and the desire to co-run a company that‚Äôs already crushing it.

Mostly I like to work either as freelancer, consultant, remote jobs or on my own products and research ideas.

One reason I am particularly excited about network school is because I believe this is how communities and even nations of future should work.

Grouping people based on their shared values and interests makes so much more sense than grouping based on geographical location of birth.

Also, I believe that it's not just opportunity but also our responsibility to have a specific vision for the world we want to see when technology makes EVERYTHING possible because pre-internet era institutions won't survive post-AGI era.

IMO, one right direction would be to create a world of abundance and compassion for all biological beings.

So far, it was Natural selection that helped in gene improvement but it also led to so much cruelty and suffering because it is based on scarcity of resources and zero sum competition.

In world of abundance, we can just program genes and improve them in specific directions we want.

All the species should be augmented with artificial intelligence and inter-species communication should be made possible so that planet earth actually becomes a much more healthy and happy place to live.

Some projects I am exploring currently - - Possibility of test-time reasoning in spatial domain instead of just text domain. (Make models shape rotators rather than just wordcels). - A better UI for LLMs using graphs instead of linear chats.

‚Ä¢ For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same‚Äîthis is still ongoing and one of the main reasons I applied to NS.

‚Ä¢ Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto‚Äîsetting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.).

‚Ä¢ Learning a lot about AI‚Äîboth top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).

‚Ä¢ Beginner Muay Thai learner‚Äîwould love to take classes at NS.

Anyone else interested in learning or teaching?

Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, etc., are also on the table.

Let‚Äôs connect! **Network School** I‚Äôll be arriving in April, and my first project will be setting up a microschool/homeschooling community to make it easier for families to stay at NS for extended periods.

The model will follow the **2-hour model / Alpha School approach**, where kids learn autonomously with AI tutors at their own pace‚Äîwithout human tutors for the basic core curriculum.

Next, the microschool would expand to afternoon sessions led by human coaches/mentors/motivators.

Their role would be to help kids discover their passions, cultivate curiosity, and become 10x versions of themselves through human collaboration and AI.

The focus would be on life skills, soft skills, and preparing for the future.

The ultimate goal: involve kids in **building the future of society**‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs their future, and they should help shape it as soon as possible.

I hope to bootstrap this as quickly as possible.

If you‚Äôre interested‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre bringing kids, planning to stay long-term, or want to be involved‚Äîplease reach out!

I‚Äôll be at NS in April, then taking a short break before returning in June/July and staying until the end.

My plan is to get the microschool up and running quickly so my family can join long-term next academic year‚Äîand to make it easier for other families to come.

There‚Äôs no society without families and kids, so this will be my top priority.

I should probably put this intro on a website instead of dropping this wall of text here üòÖ Anyway, excited to be here!

And seriously‚Äîif you‚Äôre interested in the microschool or coming with kids, let‚Äôs connect. https://x.com/keo https://warpcast.com/keo604 [linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/)",discord

I grew up as an expat kid in Algeria and have been living in Bali for the past three years.

I consider myself a builder, with a strong software engineering background‚ÄîI started coding at five.

I love solving problems that others think are unsolvable, with a strong emphasis on user experience.

Growing up in Algeria and then in a post-Soviet country, I failed a lot and learned to crawl through broken glass to make it.

I‚Äôm a cockroach, not a unicorn.

A cockroach with a Liberland passport üôÇ I‚Äôm excited to join the Network School because I rarely meet like-minded individuals who are extreme risk-takers, fanatically love reimagining difficult problems from first principles, and embrace, learn from, and enjoy all the associated challenges. **Things I value:**

‚Ä¢ **Human connections** ‚Äì Honesty, Empathy, Love

‚Ä¢ **Self-sovereignty, Liberty** ‚Äì NAP, Voluntarism

‚Ä¢ **Spending time offline** ‚Äì Enjoying the analogue waves

‚Ä¢ **Building online** ‚Äì Crunching digital bits **Things I care about:**

‚Ä¢ The future of society

‚Ä¢ Posthumanism

‚Ä¢ Everything that can be derived from the above two:

‚Ä¢ Detaching from the legacy system to become free, borderless, and crypto-native

‚Ä¢ Building a new societal blueprint

‚Ä¢ Safe superintelligence

‚Ä¢ Health, safe food, longevity, sports

‚Ä¢ 22nd-century education

‚Ä¢ Preparing for what‚Äôs to come in the next five years - and what's to come after **A few fun things I‚Äôve done:**

‚Ä¢ Got together with a dozen people to create a community/village of like-minded techno-optimists.

The project failed, but I learned a lot about biointensive farming‚Äîand it‚Äôs also where I discovered Bitcoin (this was in 2010).

Back then, we used Bitcoin as money to trade veggies, land, labor, etc.

No one thought of it as ‚ÄúHODL never spend digital gold.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Bootstrapped Hungary‚Äôs crypto ecosystem‚Äî[founded the first exchange/brokerage](https://mrcoin.eu) (since exited), launched ATMs (with a highly ranked central bank officer [praising Bitcoin at the inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDvEgqsbZow)üòÖ), organized educational workshops, meetups, etc.

Fun fact: We have the longest-running [Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.bitcoinbudapest.hu) in the world!

‚Ä¢ Erected the first [Satoshi Statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/em74TdeSsbw?t=2363s) in Budapest, which became a pilgrimage site for crypto enthusiasts (and is now the default ‚ÄúSatoshi image‚Äù in the press).

‚Ä¢ Built a small GPU rig to learn about mining‚Äîand it ended up mining Ethereum‚Äôs [genesis block](https://x.com/keo/status/1272844823834308608).

‚Ä¢ Helped fund and bootstrap a pirate microschool/homeschooling club for my son 10 years ago because we couldn‚Äôt find any alternatives we were happy with.

This later became a state-accredited [decentralized network of 18 microschools](https://budapestschool.org/en/) with 800+ students in Hungary.

‚Ä¢ Co-founded [Reaction](https://reaction.global) with Stanford Executive Program classmates‚Äîa VC fund focused on solving important problems.",discord

Been fixing hardware and cracking into my neighbors WEP ‚Äú*secured*‚Äù WiFi since I was 13 since we couldn't afford working computers or internet.

I got a job in networking when I was 18, and have since graduated the University of Houston with a BS in Computer Information Systems.

Somewhere in between there I learned about crypto (I will only answer the question ‚Äú*how*‚Äù over a Moutai) and I‚Äôve been hooked for nearly the last 10 years.

In my day-job, I work at a global accounting firm where I teach professionals why they need to care about crypto and how it works.

I also am in the process of scaling our blockchain community.

I love what I do, but I‚Äôll be taking a month off of that to come see what the Network School is all about in July.

After (*during*) work I also work on whatever side-projects I think would be fun, scalable, and make me a millionaire before 30 (I‚Äôve got 9 months left).

My favorite one right now is a Twitter page that automatically enhances and highlights AI art that I handpick, though it hasn't made me any money (yet).

When I‚Äôm not doing that, I love to workout (actually hate it), walk in the sun, be at the beach, play basketball (big one), and win Marvel Rivals games (plat now, but just getting started).

In 2024, I launched Venture Launch, an accelerator and fundraising platform designed for early-stage startups.

The platform combines a milestone-driven approach with decentralized governance through a DAO, helping startups secure funding while giving investors access to exclusive opportunities.

I regularly speak at global tech events and mentor emerging founders.

Excited to be here and looking forward to connecting.

I‚Äôm Ursula O‚ÄôKuinghttons, and my journey has always been about stories, whether it‚Äôs interviewing migrants searching for a new home or Heads of State shaping the future.

I started in journalism at Prisa Media (Spain), covering major global events and expanding media across Europe, Spain and Latin America.

But in 2012, I became fascinated by the idea that technology, specifically blockchain, could rebuild the media industry, making it more transparent, independent, and resilient.

That curiosity led me to ConsenSys, where I was a founding member of Civil, one of the first attempts to decentralize journalism.

Later, as Director of Communications and Partnerships at the Web3 Foundation in Switzerland, I helped to launchPolkadot.

Now, as CMO of Scytale Digital VC and an advisor to Project Liberty (Frequency blockchain), I‚Äôm focused on building bridges between technology, media, and business.

Project Liberty recently made a bid to acquire TikTok in the US with the goal of decentralizing it.

We shall see how that unfolds, but the ambition is clear: put control back into the hands of users.

A few exciting things ahead: I‚Äôm organizing Decentralize Lugano, a finance-focused event in Switzerland, in May 8th, and I‚Äôll also be at ETH Denver, where we‚Äôre hosting Frequency House, and Merge Buenos Aires, where I‚Äôll be presenting a Web3 documentary on FC Barcelona, a project I‚Äôm proud to be part of.

I‚Äùll be joining the NS In August, I‚Äôll be moving to Singapore with my 12-year-old son, and we‚Äôre both looking forward to this new chapter.

I will be joining the NS March 1.

I have been interested in post-nationalist (opt-in) states for over 20 years, and how to develop them.

Recently, this included writing a pilot screenplay for a streaming series called Imagi Nation; it is a ‚Äúpoli fi‚Äù [political science fiction] story about the founding of the first global-scale Network State.

Before that, I wrote a blog called Expat Nation, anticipating many of the ideas that Balaji advocated in The Network State.

Now, I am working to found an intentional community in Maine that incorporates DAO governance and technology.

Made a friend ""Awais"" üá≥üá¥ today and we went to Singapore but ended up in a historical Supreme Court holding cell!

So then I bet a bunch of more money that there'll be a ceasefire in the Ukraine war before Trump's inauguration; so I'm a bit tense and constantly checking my phone for news related to that event.

I'm Gokhan, originally from Turkey.

After graduating from university, I moved to China, where I spent 4 years in Beijing and another 4 in Shenzhen.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve been living nomadic but have recently in the process of settling in Hong Kong.

I‚Äôve been in the crypto space since 2017, starting as one of the first foreign employees at Huobi's Beijing HQ.

Now, I lead investment and research at IOSG Ventures, and had the chance to invest early in many of today's transformative projects.

In my free time, I enjoy running, football (the kind you actually play with your feet), and hitting the gym.

I‚Äôm also pretty good at Chinese, but as they say, it‚Äôs a lifelong learning journey!

Music is important to me and I like listening to jazz and techno music.

I‚Äôm Chinese-American from Midwest but mostly exited the US since around 10 years ago, first moving to Brasil and then now in Southeast Asia in the Philippines.

Got two young sons who I hope to be netizens of network societies in the future.

For much of my life, I‚Äôve tried to as a neutral avoid collateral damage from the escalating US-China conflict, but the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù somehow always comes back ‚Äî most recently in the form of nearly monthly South China Sea scares near the Philippines (which could rock the entire Indo-Pacific region) and fears of return of McCarthyism by US/US ‚Äúvassals‚Äù (not so much about the ‚Äúanti-Communist‚Äù part but concerns rooted in the potentially unfair and unethical targeting of particular minority disapora groups).

I am thankful for the frameworks that Balaji has envisioned - for it gives me hope that milions of neutrals, nomads, migrants, third-culture-kids, etc can try to find peaceful independent alternate paths for themselves and their families ‚Äî hopefully peacefully independent from clutches of legacy nation states that have power to commit violence, confiscation, cancellation, suspicion, persecution, and shaming of those accused of being not ‚Äúnationalistic/patriotic‚Äù enough or accused of not loving ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù enough.

Hoping for a future in which my kids and others in their generation would no longer be judged or limited by the color of their passport/national id/social security card. (Nowadays, to be born, to go to school, to get employed, to travel globally, to get married, to have kids, to retire, and even to die and pass on inheritance ‚Äî one would need recognition from a nation state!).

Nothing against nation states, respecting them, just seeking peaceful alternatives.

I look forward to learning from everyone ‚Äî it is a blessing to connect with and learn from so many thinkers, innovators, entreprenuers, and aspiring network state/network society netizens in this community.

I am humbled to have the chance to learn ‚Äî and I hope to continue to come back to Forest City from time to time.

A big thanks to Balaji and the NS team for making things happen.

I'm Marie, I'm a full stack dev and designer.

I love to craft things so I learned illustrator, a tiny bit of animation and some 3D.

Would love to have more time to dedicate to this though I've been in the crypto space for 3 years now and love talking about tech, society, opensource, monetary policies, history,decentralization.

How do we create new decentralized platforms, new community currencies and in the end new states?

I'm mostly aligned with the cyberpunk ethos so in this search for meaning in the crypto sea, I spent some time in - the ReFI (regenerative finance) space, trying to put a value on nature.

I'm very interested in the food industry and how it could be improved - governance and more recently futarchy: governance by the markets.

It's been a pretty interesting path of thinking for me - i'm learning about cryptography, zk and privacy.

It's time to focus on this before everything is traceable I'm currently building an app called ascend https://x.com/ascend_sh : an accountability social network that lets you stake and bet on the completion of a routine or a task with your friends.

Could be sport, pushing commits on github, twetting more, anything.

It's still very early and we plan to launch soon, would love to do some user interviews with you guys.

I could only stay 8 days sadly but it's already something and I want to take the most out of it.

I'm super excited to see new things on the search for the network states and would love to find a way to contribute to it (agricultural projects to have good quality food, help building online tools, ...).

Most of the time, these are exclusive because there's a large number of applicants + it could also depend on how they're filtering applicants based on views/opinions, proof-of-work or any number of categories.

As they scale, they will increase capacity.

The best way to get accepted is to start contributing early & voluntarily, not just to attend but to build something that you also believe in.

That'll almost guarantee a spot and also lead to making new friends before you even go there.

Gary here from Vancouver.

I've been a renegade filmmaker since the 1990's and an ardent advocate of Open-Source Everything since the early 2000s.

I co-founded the Decentralized Dance Party (DDP) in 2009 and in the years since, have hosted over 100 roaming ""Open-Source"" street Parties in many cities across the globe, turning hundreds of thousands of people on to Radical Decentralization and new modes of social and societal possibility!

Check it out at http://TheDDP.com I've also been deeply involved in the greater crypto / Decentralization community since 2011, with many written works, short films, co-founding Camp Dogecoin at Burning Man 2014, Camp Decentral at Burning Man 2017, DogeCon Vancouver, the Dogecoin Foundation in 2021, Million Doge Disco, the DogeClaren and many other projects and initiatives üôÇ Also attended Vitalia / Prospera this past February, met a bunch of the folks in the movement and had a great experience.

I've been fascinated by the prospect of a ""Network State"" for many years and have been discussing and brainstorming such a venture for quite some time.

I am EXTREMELY excited to contribute to the movement and see limitless possibility here in Forest City and beyond!

Excited to be laying the groundwork with all y'all for a maximally free, peaceful and prosperous future!

Bootstrapped a defense contractor in war zones, then a YC-funded secure virtualization company (S11) which I sold to Cloudflare and worked there for a couple years.

Did a disposable laptop company for China/Russia high risk travel, then moved to Switzerland when I joined a crypto foundation board and helped them to a top-10 market cap launch.

Then moved to Puerto Rico where I now do crypto insurance, investing, and some anonymous payments and infra for network states stuff.

I wanted to formally introduce myself as I won't be able to attend the conference and the first 2 weeks - I'll be at a friend's wedding and will join you all on October 4.

I am fascinated by Network States and grateful for the work the NS team has done to put this together.

My FOMO is at an all-time high missing the first bit!

I'm Shar from Vancouver.

My entrepreneurial background spans multiple industries including agrichemicals, cannabis, real estate, entertainment, and some tech (an area I'm hoping to expand on).

I've worked on pre-IPO capital raises, advised startup founders, and served on a co-op board (lots of parallels with web3).

I thrive in project-based sprints, working with small, motivated teams to solve exciting problems.

I'm coming off a six-year sprint building and exiting a cannabis company.

The past year has been exploratory, focusing on new ways of work and refining not just what I want to work on, but how.

Themes of particular interest: -Digital products and apps -Audience-first building -AI-driven low-cost development -Projects beyond excessive regulatory scrutiny -[as Balaji discusses regarding the administrative state](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWMcRRkuak>) These align with my belief that smaller teams can do high-leverage work (@naval speaks about this a lot -[see page 60 of the Almanack of Naval Ravikant](<https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf>).

Long-term, I aim to build skills and a network for a venture studio-type model, creating tasteful projects for people with audiences (yes, this could be a DAO, my crypto friends).

NS couldn't have come at a better time.

Inspired by [Levelsio's 12 projects in 12 months](<https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>), my goal is to collaborate on ""indie hacker"" type projects.

Instead of solo development, multiple people with domain expertise building, testing, and launching projects quickly.

See what fails or gains traction, focusing on building for or with an audience.

I have a few projects I've been building with my own network but would be cool to build with some likeminded NS admits -would be extra cool to look at projects we could build for the NS community!

If this interests you, feel free to DM me or start a thread.

Joining the Network School feels like it's the ""connecting the dots"" moment in my life!

I‚Äôm 22 years old and have been homeschooled since I was 10.

In 2019, I founded China‚Äôs only homeschooler community.

The desire to see the community achieve prosperity through emergence led me to explore organizational development, which is how I recognize DAO.

Once my anarchist spirit met crypto, there was no turning back.

Over the past five years, I‚Äôve been involved in over 100 projects without attending college.

About 30% didn‚Äôt fail, and 3% were a big success.

Last year, as a digital nomad at Zuzalu, I began to wonder why college couldn‚Äôt be nomadic, prove yourself with portfolio instead of diploma?

I tried to bring this idea to life with hundreds of co-creators and got $206,000 in pledged donations, but everything was shut down by the Political Security Bureau in China.

I nearly ended up in jail.

They feared the education for freedom and the infiltration through crypto investment.

After that, I realized it was time to leave China and build on a global scale.

So when I saw the Network School, I know it's where I should come.",discord

My name is Max Kordek.

My specialization is in technology, crypto and futurism.

In crypto since nearly 13 years, founder since 8 years when it all started with Lisk for which I collected 14,000 BTC in 2016.

I founded: - Onchain Foundation, a non-profit crypto venture builder and research institute - Lisk, originally a JavaScript L1, now a L2 part of Optimism‚Äôs/Base‚Äôs Superchain - Pass App, a smart wallet using account abstraction - Lightcurve, Berlin‚Äôs longest-standing blockchain agency I‚Äôm a big advocate of the idea behind network states, and I‚Äôm big into health and longevity.

After being at Bryan Johnson‚Äôs house last week, it became apparent to me that I need to dive much deeper into technology and longevity!

Therefore, the Network School sounds like the perfect opportunity for me!

My intention is to stay on the island for the entire time (only being away for short business trips in October and November), while being there I‚Äôd like to challenge myself and build a small project from scratch, get physically super-fit, and soak up as much knowledge from the school and participants as possible.

The Network State seems like our best hope at creating a bedrock for true progress, reshaping possibilities not to not just only sovereignty, but also the human superpower of cooperation, and unencumbered innovation across diverse spheres (e.g., catalyzing breakthroughs like the gene therapies emerging in Pr√≥spera, Honduras).

My name is Lane.

I was born and raised in the oil fields of the Midwestern United States before moving to sunny California at the age of 18 to study computer science.

Growing up in a family business instilled in me a great appreciation for value creation, individual sovereignty, personal responsibility, and rugged entrepreneurship from a young age.

I‚Äôm interested in absolutely everything but my favorite project right now is a suite of software that uses ML to evaluate seismic data and locate new oil reserves with ~90+% accuracy.

I‚Äôve traveled the world for the past few years and couldn‚Äôt agree more with Balaji‚Äôs vision for the Network State.

We need to move beyond centralized states that maintain power through fiat, war-mongering, and sowing division.

I envision a future comprised of sovereign individuals who maintain peace and trust through smart contracts and blockchain and increasingly democratize economic opportunity through innovation ‚Äúin the world of bits and atoms‚Äù as Thiel would say.

Balaji‚Äôs courage and foresight in organizing something of this magnitude is simply incredible.

I'm Sharon, born and bred in Singapore; currently running HQ.xyz - an onchain business bank to power our generation of open money.

I.e. to enable self-sovereignty while having a global and seamless flow of money.

A little bit about myself: - Caught the ""software is eating the world"" bug in 2008 while I was surrounded by finance/consulting junkies back in college (üòÖ at me potentially being one of the older members in our cohort) - Thankful to have learnt about BTC also while in college, with a bright orange bitcoin ATM in our college lobby - Went down the rabbit hole when 2017''s early wave of ICOs began Excited to join NS because: - I‚Äôve had several moments in my life when financial constraints prevented me from pursuing opportunities beyond Singapore.

Witnessing how stronger financial resources opened doors for my peers to globally renowned opportunities, which in turn led to even more, was a major reality check for me. - This experience fueled my 'chip on my shoulder' to create and pursue global opportunities, even while being homebound - It also cemented my strong belief in crypto as the decentralized and open financial system of our generation, allowing me to work alongside global talent, regardless of where we‚Äôre based.

Lately, though, I‚Äôve started feeling jaded by the PvP nature of our crypto space.

I‚Äôm looking forward to my time in NS to meet fresh faces, reignite my enthusiasm for the industry, and cut through the noise.

Can't wait to meet and grow with everyone over the coming months!

Few words about me: ‚Äì Digital nomad, originally from Russia. ‚Äì Computer science degree, but I really don't like to codeüòÖ even with AI. ‚Äì All my career happens in crypto: since 2017, I used to have a marketing agency for ICOs, then I worked with NEAR, TON and many, many more web3 startups. ‚Äì Business development professional, attending TOKEN2049 as a representative for a client. ‚Äì Have a crypto school, educated over 700 people how to do crypto.

Despite my love for crypto, I don't feel 100% fulfilled üò¶ Thinking about two projects: ‚Äì ADHDAO ‚Äì to fund researches about ADHD treatments and methods to make life better for people with ADHD. ‚Äì Something with garbage, want to make the world cleaner üôÇ I see NS as a place I can't find in the real world...

My journey has been a mix of successes and failures - I've had 3 startups that didn't make it, managed to sell 1, and now I'm working on building another.

Currently, I'm working remotely for a crypto company, where I'm juggling various roles - from providing technical support and troubleshooting blockchain issues to developing automated systems with Python. üñ•Ô∏èüîß It's a constant learning experience!

Alongside this, I'm also building a new business with AI, exploring the exciting possibilities in this field. ü§ñ But I'm very much a beginner in these areas, eager to learn from all of you who have such impressive backgrounds.

One personal challenge I've set for myself is marathon running. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm training for my 4th marathon, aiming for a sub-4 hour timing.

It's a goal I set 5 years ago and haven't achieved yet, but I'm using it as a way to teach myself persistence and not giving up on goals we set.

Any running buddies?

At Network School, I'm here primarily to learn.

I'm excited about the concept of network states and how we might create transformative projects, but I know I have so much to absorb from all of you.

I'm ready to soak up knowledge about tech, entrepreneurship, personal growth, and especially about setting up new societies and governance models. üåêüèóÔ∏è It's a fascinating area I'm keen to explore further.

My time in the corporate world was interesting, as I never had a fixed position within any company.

I enjoyed problem-solving, so I eventually ended up becoming a consultant, helping manufacturing suppliers reduce scrap and meet OEM standards.

After working in the automotive and Aerospace industries for 10 years, the pandemic accelerated my journey to become fully independent and finally broke away from the corporate world.

Being an artist was always in the back of my mind, and Web3 introduced me to a new world where art and engineering are celebrated.

I have been creating products and experiences in Web3 since 2021 and shipped my first game in early 2024.

It wasn‚Äôt an easy journey, but it was something I needed to go through.

Me and my wife (who was also accepted in NS <:newcountry:994308986578935958> ) run an Indie gaming studio and also create courses on the side to help creators break out of their shell.

I'm Milan from the Netherlands, also known as Mira Hurley on Twitter (it's a long story..) My background is mostly finance and economics, having founded my own companies in the sector, worked for the Dutch central bank where I learnt just how slow-moving institutions can be, and having first encountered Bitcoin in 2012.

Nowadays I'm a self-taught programmer, together with my co-founder we built NanoGPT which uses crypto to allow anyone, anywhere to access the best LLMs and image generation tools.

The Network School is genuinely the perfect combination of everything that I'm excited about:- crypto & AI are my main interests and fill my professional life nowadays, Bryan Johnson is the inspiration for our health protocol, Balaji's (and Patri Friedman's!) vision of the future of states is the kind of future I want to see (and help build) and since my girlfriend also got accepted we even get to do this together.

On a sidenote we're broadly being declared crazy by friends and family for ""joining this cult"" since this is starting just after we got back from a 6-month trip through South America, but I'm super excited about it.

I'm hoping we can make it to the Network State Conference in time.

The previous one in Amsterdam was great so if anyone is doubting I can really recommend it.

I initially got into crypto when I was 15 because I wanted to start trading but couldn't get onboarded onto traditional brokers.

I then learned about the permissionless nature of public blockchains and the ideology behind it, never left since.

At the end of my studies I then joined one crypto startup doing on-chain private credit, and then co-founded a portfolio management startup where I designed investment strategies based on on-chain data for token selection & rebalancing among other things.

I am also quite interested in AI, and created some personal projects (one of which is an AI agent focused on summarizing student's slides and books to learn more efficiently).

I decided to join the network school because I was at a point in my life where I figured I needed more personal experiences to know myself & where I want to go in the future better, and be able to learn from very interesting people from all over the world.

I also love playing Frisbee (will bring one if anyone wants to chill on the beach durring the sunset), swimming, Music, and experimenting with new technologies I look forward to meeting you all!",discord

Is it possible to create a Blueprint-friendly Burning Man experience?

I still went to university studying computer science and business for a dual degree.

It mostly felt like a waste though and I spent most time learning following my own curiosity.

Since then I started a digital agency building POC for startups, developed a titanium-based DJ headphone used by top DJs like Diplo and Skrillex, co-founded a record label, built a cabin village in the mountains and co-founded a technology company developing AI models for automating valuation of real estate assets and opening up single-family homes at scale as a new asset class for institutional investors.

Since my days in school I've been thinking about how demotivating the education system is.

Academia is killing creativity and the joy of learning with its assembly line methods.

I want to encourage students to dive straight into building at the edges of progress, without waiting for an academic diploma as a stamp of approval at the cost of your soul.

I‚Äôm exploring a medium combining crypto, digital art, animated video and gaming, infused with our deepest knowledge.

This is where my focus is now and Network States seems like the perfect place to apply it.

I like to read widely, produce (mostly electronic) music, design houses, take long walks and think about how the world works.

I‚Äôm always drawn to the intersection of art and technology and learning about the frontier of innovation in various fields.

My goal at NS is to meet like-minded people who want to replace dysfunctional institutions and build better environments for optimism to flourish.

Happy to connect with anyone who resonates and thank you <@777003807279677500> for making this happen.

I'm from London originally and have been moving around the world over the last few years, between Europe, Asia and America.

I'm coming to NS because I'm looking for a community with a vision.

I'm interested in future societies built to accommodate frontier technology like life extension, AGI, diverse intelligence and space exploration.

At a time when all this is on the horizon, the West feels increasingly negative and backward-looking, and I'm no longer convinced it is the right environment for these ideas to flourish.

Something new is needed to bring together people who still believe in the future, and I hope that NS can be the seed.

Work-wise, I'm interested in stories/media and how they influence what gets done in the world.

I'm a developer/designer hybrid, and I'm currently bootstrapping a new project in AI narrative media/simulations.

Before that, I started an online learning company and worked on a series of other consumer tech products.

I have some experience in crypto after working on an education DAO, and have degrees in biology and material science.

I also bought $BODEN once, so I guess that makes me an investor too?

I'm Bjoern from Germany, and really look forward to Network School.

I always was interested in libertarian principles and looking for a truly meritocratic, free community.

Back in 2015, I was one of the early visitors to Liberland, what should have been a new, libertarian micronation, but did not work out.

I first bought one Bitcoin in 2013 for ‚Ç¨100 in cash, back then I was looking for a privacy-focused way to pay online.

Back then it was just one option on a long list next to paysafecard, VCCs, and prepaid cards, but crypto quickly became something I really care about for freedom and state-resistance.

Today, I run Lendorse, a startup that helps finance talented but underprivileged students from developing and emerging countries to study STEM MSc programs in Europe.

There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, because I‚Äôve become increasingly skeptical about Europe's future.

I‚Äôm very interested in longevity.

I see death as the final enemy and find it crazy how indifferent society is to it.

I‚Äôve started my own ""Bryan light"" longevity protocol, with regular blood tests and various supplements, but I still struggle with sleep discipline and maintaining a good diet and hope for the peer pressure of the program.

Professionally, I studied economics and business at LSE and St.

Gallen.

After a couple of years at McKinsey, I left the corporate world and have been in the startup ecosystem ever since (TradFi & Logistics).

I'm Bj√∂rn, of Swedish origin as you might assume.

I spent most of my formative years in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Now, at 23 years old, I find myself living in Spain, which presents an interesting contrast to my background and beliefs. **|Current Projects|** **Building a decentralized water utility** I'm incredibly excited to be attending the network school with my partner.

Balaji's network state thesis is at the core of my startup's vision: I'm building a decentralized water utility for network states, currently focused on Latin America.

We aim to lower economic barriers to clean water access through reimagined core infrastructure and ownership models. (By the way, anyone have contacts in El Salvador? üòú) **EU/accelerationism podcast** Living in Spain is conflicting for me.

It's challenging being a pro-capitalist, small-government kind of guy in this environment.

However, I've channeled this challenge into action: 1.

I've established a substantial chapter of the EU/ACC movement through strong local business communities. 2.

I started a podcast where we stream on X/twitter Spaces, amplifying voices from a network of local live players.

We've already reached over 600 attendees in our first stream.

I tend to sway pessimistic about Europe's current trajectory, but I‚Äôm determined to spark honest conversations about it and empower live players who can actually make a change. **|Personal Interests|** While I enjoy fitness, music, and playing guitar, above ALL I find myself irresistibly drawn to the mysteries of ancient civilizations, a passion that permeates every aspect of my life and intellectual growth.

I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and continuing to work towards innovative solutions in both the digital and physical realms.

I'm 31 from Augusta GA.

Spent my adult life living in Atlanta, Austin, Antwerp, and currently Buenos Aires.

I studied computer science and chemistry at georgia tech, and did a finance masters in Belgium.

Some things that I enjoy doing: * Being physically active (I love kettlebell and bodyweight training) * Reading classic and nonfiction books * Researching investment ideas * Programming * Living in walkable cities Something interesting about me is I have a pilot‚Äôs license and come from a family of pilots.

I spent a good portion of my 20s at an IT consulting firm working on software projects at large companies and experienced the guts of corporate America.

In 2021, after feeling unfilfilled and alienated by the corporate culture, I resigned to focus on stock & crypto investing and tinkering with projects.

Fitness has been part of my life since I was 15.

I'm a kettlebell enthusiast.

I also want to try new forms of exercise while on the island, especially yoga and stretching because I have skipped that more or less ha.

I'm coming to NS because Balaji‚Äôs idea of a network state has always excited me.

The moment I saw his post about NS and read '""We got an island"" I applied ha.

My life - - In crypto since 2014, and always believe it‚Äôs not a game about money.

I agree with Balaji in so many ways especially when it comes to future of the humanity, but it might take so many years or even generations for things to start moving (I guess that‚Äôs why we are learning to live longer or simply don‚Äôt die in this school) - Did my undergrad in the US and learned English - Previously a journalist based in Washington D.C. reporting on world politics - Switched to producing/directing stand-up comedy shows in China.

Show biz in China is weirdly fun! - Now a full-time writer, also run a travel agency focusing on tours in South East Asia What I can provide to NS (just did a little brainstorming) - I make Chinese food and hot pot.

If food is too healthy in NS, I‚Äôll try to cook and share food.

Not sure if we‚Äôll have access to a decent kitchen, but we are close to a modern civilization (Singapore), so I‚Äôm sure we can figure something out - I take people to Bali all the time.

I‚Äôm like half a local, so if you need tips/recommendations, hey (waving hands) - I directed & produced quite a few stand-up shows, podcasts & talk shows.

I like talking to and interviewing people.

And here obviously we see so many interesting people with fantastic life stories - I read through everyone‚Äôs intro and already have so many questions to ask.

If you are also interested in producing something creative during your time in NS, let‚Äôs chat!

Happy to exchange ideas / collaborate - I‚Äôm writing a novel and one of the main characters is a crypto bro.

I‚Äôve been living a nomadic life for the past couple of years, mostly between Dubai and Bangkok.

In 2013, I quit my corporate job as a Mechanical Engineer with $500 in my pocket to travel the world and ended up in Toronto.

Thanks to my degree, which is useless overseas, gave me the chance to explore and experiment with countless opportunities life has to offer, from waiting tables, bartending, real estate investing, and photography, to content creation and running my own restaurant, which got featured in multiple local Canadian media and became one of the top takeout spots in Toronto during the pandemic.

I lived in 6 different countries (soon to be 7 with Forest City!) across 4 continents and visited 65+ countries/territories.

I‚Äôve come to realize that no country is perfect, it‚Äôs only perfect for you at a specific time in your life and (almost) all governments are the same.

I‚Äôm heavily invested in Web3, starting with DeFi and then NFTs during the Pandemic.

Together with my husband (who will also be attending NS), we launched an indie gaming studio specializing in Metaverse games and are also building an online learning platform.

I‚Äôve been interested in longevity since 2019, when I first read Dr.

Sinclair‚Äôs Lifespan and have been using Bryan Johnson‚Äôs Blueprint products plus attending events like the VitaDAO DeSci Summit and the Akshay Summit in Dubai, where <@777003807279677500> was a speaker.

I remember thinking, ‚ÄúGreat events like this should be longer!‚Äù and here we are ‚ÄúThe Network School!‚Äù Super stoked to join Network School to create, connect, collaborate, and contribute with all of you who share the same values, vision, worldview, and excitement for life!",discord

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been deeply involved with Zafra Nature Reserve, a Colombian community initiative in eco-tourism, eco-education and bioregional regeneration.

From here I lead Natural Movement retreats for international participants, run MovNat teacher training certifications across the Americas, and maintain an online and in-person embodiment coaching practice.

I'm a software developer building a decentralized code collaboration platform for open source development with my longtime friend and co-founder, Parth (he is also part of the program).

I've always been fascinated by programming and its power to bring ideas to life.

It's much more accessible compared to other careers where specialized instruments or capital are required for research.

In comparison, we only need a laptop and an internet connection to conduct experiments; our ideas are the only limitation.

I started working with Parth in 2019.

I had just left my 3-year stint at a tech startup and was taking a break to learn about machine learning, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.

I still vividly remember the first time I sat down with Parth as he explained the concept behind cryptocurrencies and their practical applications, convincing me to work with him.

More than the financial and speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, I was excited about the power to create micro-economies and incentives that could easily mobilize people across the world to work towards common goals.

After that, we never looked back, and I've learned a lot both professionally and personally.

In recent years, I've also been practicing meditation and improving my lifestyle for better health and slower aging.

We have also been remotely working from Dubai, Bangkok and Banglore.

I am really excited after reading through all your intros and thrilled to be part of this program and exchange ideas with all of you.

Most recently I've been building funding platforms on Ethereum.

I recently started a part-time course in business development with a focus on sustainability.

I worked on a project that explored how the innovative funding mechanisms in blockchain ecosystems can be applied to humanitarian aid and funding of regenerative activities.

Just read the Innovators (Walter Isaacson) and inspired by the way it portrays innovation as a team activity powered by cross-disciplinary skills so I'm hoping to explore some collaborations and learning from each other.

I'm interested in expanding my skills in areas like AI, cryptography, digital governance, game theory, and applying them to today's challenges while keeping a keen eye on their future implications.

The moment I read Balaji‚Äôs announcement of the Network School I knew I was meant to attend, even before reading the term ""latin-american libertarians""!

Since getting to know and aligning with punk6529‚Äôs vision for an open metaverse, I became fully invested ‚Äì time and money ‚Äì in building our decentralized future.

Not only I was one of the first Meme Artists to create for 6529‚Äôs project (https://seize.io/the-memes/30), I am also one of the biggest collectors of 6529's The Memes ‚Äî which have just been revealed as the fundamental building blocks for a practically functioning Network State ‚Äî and among the highest reputed members of their network (https://seize.io/hugofaz).

I have been collecting culturally relevant NFTs not just for myself but also for Casa NUA (https://en.nft.nua.casa), the southern hemisphere‚Äôs first permanent IRL Museum for Decentralized Art, which I founded in 2023 in the heart of S√£o Paulo, and which now holds regular exhibitions of art minted as NFTs, culturally educating a new generation of artists, collectors and enthusiasts.

But besides all of the above, the Burn pillar of NS hit me even harder.

Having my father diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease in 2015 got me since embarked on a personal journey to optimize my physical (and thus my brain‚Äôs) health and gain as much longevity as I can to keep building and seeing flourish our shared envisioned future of peace, freedom [to transact] and knowledge.

I have recently began using my social platform on Instagram (https://instagram.com/hugofaz) to share this health journey daily and inspire others to do the same for themselves, becoming a health and fitness influencer of sorts, while also relying on my follower community to discipline myself.

I follow Bryan Johnson‚Äôs achievements closely!

I‚Äôm Nate, an Americanüá∫üá∏/Kiwiüá≥üáø born in Hong Kong, my early childhood was based in China/New Zealand.

Middle/high school and uni were completed in the US, earning a bachelor's degree in nuclear physics.

Solo travel became one of my favorite hobbies, with adventures in ~30 countries.

My view on life is it‚Äôs the most realistic MMORPG, with each new location/role as the next level, full of trials to overcome.

Other hobbies include flying drones, reading, trading, hiking, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.

Artists and digital nomads influenced my philosophy about work and purpose, particularly around untethering oneself from a physical location while contributing to an aligned tribe.

As for work, I‚Äôve played different roles such as a medical imaging researcher, soul-sucking fortune 500 company intern, AP/IB science and math teacher at international schools, bizdev co-founder for a Xiaohongshu (Chinese Instagram) based travel agency, co-founder of a memecoin market/social analytics website, growth hacker at a Y Combinator backed startup, creator of a Zoom based web3 introductory course.

So far, I‚Äôve found education and building to be my most satisfying work.

A data-hungry scientist, educator, and adventurer is how I best describe myself.

I work to apply the scientific method to my life from diet and exercise to learning and relationships.

I‚Äôm passionate about education, applications of decentralized blockchain tech, health/longevity, AI, self-determination, community building, self-custody, and freedom.

Recently I‚Äôve been doing some soul searching about how to spend my time and energy.

When I read <@777003807279677500> post about the Network School, my hair stood up.

It gave me a wonderful sense of inspiration and in that moment, I **KNEW** it was exactly what I needed to be a part of, in any shape or form.

My goals for it are to learn/burn/earn, network, improve my sleep routine, share my skills, and become a founding member of the Network State.",discord

As a multiple-time founder, I've lived the now-famous saying: 'First-time founders are obsessed with product, second-time founders are obsessed with distribution.' I find myself grappling with distribution challenges frequently.

While I'm excited about collaborating to enhance technical skills (count me in for AI coding bootcamps <@940285043199320154><@903572509125906442> <@238393956747051011> <@816005819287994378> <@171355535990456320> <@668584127552946181> <@1276471200666746942>), I'm equally eager to engage in discussions about distribution strategies, success stories, and strategies for the future.

Excited to be here!

I was born and raised in a tiny village in the French countryside.

From the age of 10, I immersed myself in books daily.

At 14, I formed a group of friends around skateboarding.

Together, we financed and constructed a skatepark in our village.

This early taste of community building and bringing an idea to life fueled my ambitions.

At 19, I created a YouTube channel called 'People Of'.

It quickly gained traction in the music scene, generating millions of views every month.

It allowed me to earn my first internet money, empowering me to drop out of law school in Bordeaux and relocate to Paris.

At 21, I began exploring Augmented Reality, creating AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat.

My Instagram filters rapidly made half a billion views.

Facebook (now Meta) invited me to their London HQ.

There, I connected with fellow creators and the Facebook team behind the Spark AR software, further expanding my horizons.

Currently, I'm passionate about 3D filmmaking in real-time, a cutting-edge technique using the power of Unreal Engine 5.

This technology allows for near-instantaneous 3D rendering (unlike traditional 3D softwares that demands huge rendering time or access to costly render farms).

I believe we're on the edge of a paradigm shift, where small teams can create cinematic experiences capable of captivating millions while generating significant revenue.

This is where I'm now focusing my energy, alongside my interests in AI, cryptocurrency, and philosophy.

2. everything under the sun, in that order) and can often be found setting up book clubs.

I love meditating, have been to Vipassana twice and am honestly taken aback at the high frequency its being mentioned here. (surreal, indeed) Most of all though - I love dreaming: - About a kind and abundant world, free from diseases, suffering and limitations. - A world where we get to call the entire Universe, and not just this one lone planet, our Home.

I believe we all have the unique privilege to get to build this dream into a concrete reality - in our own lifetime. _ _P.S.

Super excited to be here!

I cannot believe this is happening.

Balaji is my online guru and one of my heroes in crypto.

The moment I saw this opportunity on twitter, I just jumped on it.

Before this, I wanted to go to Singapore for Breakpoint and Network conference just to see Balaji but this opportunity has taken things to next level where I can learn directly from the GURU himself!.

Super pumped up üôÇ My name is Ramakanth.

I am from India but living in Dubai for the last 3 years.

Did my Bachelors in IT from India and then my MBA from Canada.

Worked in Canada for 9 years but always wanted to get out of a 9 to 5 job and gain my financial freedom.

Tried quite a few things such as mobile app development, e-book writing, stock trading, sports betting etc. but nothing worked out.

Then I found crypto in Crypto in 2016 and from then on never looked back.

Thanks to the bull run in 2021, I could save some money (enough to quit my regular job) and leave Canada.

Have been in Dubai since 2021 and waiting for the next bull market to liquidate enough of my portfolio to gain financial freedom and move back to India permanently.

Lucky enough to be an early investor in projects such as Graph, Solana, Helium, Livepeer, Stacks etc.

Full time crypto investor right now.

Loving this independence and cannot think of working a 9 to 5 ever again.

Reading, Playing Cricket and Badminton, watching movies have been my hobbies lately.

Trying out Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol for the last 2 months now.

Seeing some good results and it would be interesting to meet Bryan directly and learn from him.

I am super excited to meet you all talented people out there and learn, burn and earn along with you guys.

Time to apply for those visas!

My name is Rajat(https://x.com/r_k_luthra), Me & my wife Neha, are deeply honoured to be joining the Network School amongst all you rockstars.

I have a background in the jewelry industry in India as a designer/entrepreneur.

Last year, I was introduced to Farcaster, and since then, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to design for several web3 communities.

I‚Äôve found a deep connection with some, like Nouns Dao, where I‚Äôm currently building jewelry collections & developing a Nounish jewelry brand that integrates their various communities.

I‚Äôm also working on a transmedia storytelling brand that spans a novel series, films, a jewelry brand, and games.

My aspiration is to empower people by gamifying spiritual & martial arts techniques from diverse cultures worldwide, using emerging technologies like AR/VR.

I‚Äôm pursuing programs in game design, AI filmmaking and film editing, at the side, to be a creator in these emerging mediums.

I‚Äôm excited to see meditators here, I have had experiences with a few techniques.

I‚Äôve also trained in multiple martial arts like Capoeira, BJJ, Krav Maga, etc. and have been passionate about CrossFit.

Would love to explore training & meditating together.

My life has been a quest for community‚Äîa sangha, as Buddha would say‚Äîa group of like-minded souls united by a shared purpose & now to be part of this cohort feels surreal.

From running 90 day hackathons across writing, fitness, spirituality, startups, with two friends some years back, to actually being part of the most interesting 90 day cohort on the planet, under a teacher and visionary like Balaji, I‚Äôm in awe of how life can sometimes answer your deepest dreams.

Thanks <@777003807279677500> for dreaming this dream, for manifesting this dream & for selecting a ‚Äòdark talent‚Äô like me.

So thrilled to be here.

I'm Kris, and I've been in crypto since 2017 ‚Äì it's been an amazing journey!

I have strong skills in marketing campaigns and community growth and have worked for some of the top blockchain projects before.

I love experiencing new protocols and new projects and getting involved in all the new trending narratives!

I've had the pleasure of using, buying, and researching thousands of crypto projects!

They cover a whole range of areas, from DeFi, NFT, gaming, and social dApps to AI, DePin, memecoins, and various new blockchains.

I am an individual investor now and enjoy communicating thoughts on the market and all the exciting new projects with friends.

I'm currently working on a tool that will assess the capabilities of crypto KOLs and assist retail users in making more informed investment decisions.

I'm not an experienced developer, but I'm learning fast with the help of AI!

If anyone would like to build with me, feel free to talk to me.

I've been a digital nomad for 4 years, staying mostly in China and Southeast Asia.

Right now I am studying Muay Thai in Chiang Mai until the Network School starts.

I also enjoy swimming, badminton and billiards.

I'm in my late 20s, I view myself as very libertarian / cypherpunk and vibing with that type of people is what got me in crypto a while ago.

I learned to code in a p2p school (42) where there was no teacher, the building was open 24/7, there was a skilltree of project with branches depending what area of computer science you want to explore and you got graded by other students and the school test scripts.

I've also a deep passion for economy, I think I have more than 10k hours trying to figure out how the system works but I still have a lot to figure out In crypto right now I focus on the solana ecosystem.

I've contributed with my girlfriend to metadao, the futarchy experiment on solana that's doing great and we hacked a mobile app for the last colosseum hackathon that let you challenge yourself / your friends to do stuff for example build in public or tweet more often etc ... and you get slash if you don't do it.

For the next colosseum hackathon we're thinking about reusing some of that app building blocks to build a conflict resolution / justice system for dao & network states I can't wait to meet all of you, the network states is one of the core things that gives me hope for the future",discord

Generally my never-ending love for freedom came from being banned on Paypal for trying to buy Apple Stock at 12 years old and having to pay a massive fine for that (really radicalized me to democratizing access).

I dropped out of college (Philosophy) and visited Draper University (an entrepreneurship residency program in Silicon Valley founded by Tim Draper), following that I've been founding 2 startups, with Quasar being the biggest one so far.

And after seeing so many like-minded people here, I thought I'll do it now My name is Parth (30 years old), I am from India originally.

I started my journey by dropping out of college and searching my path.

I love technology and did freelancing for a long time before entering crypto.

I ran a service company for a while before building a decentralized Github.

As AI is changing everything, I am working on another challenging idea that builds on top of it.

I love dogs and had a German shepherd for 10 years (passed away last year).

He was something that grounded me in India so after that, I moved to wherever opportunities took me.

I stay between India, Thailand and Dubai now.

I love that so many people here are into meditation, it‚Äôs amazing.

Meditation changed my life.

I started from the Vipassana retreat in Koh Phangan, thailand where I got my first experience which I couldn‚Äôt give words to and got hooked immediately.

Post that I spent 8 months meditating in a retreat in India while working remotely.

This restructured my understanding of spirituality and awareness.

I have also dabbed with longevity (food, medicines and fasting) and seen dramatic changes that the body and mind have when done strictly.

Network School is an amazing opportunity and I intend to make the most of it.

So anyone here needs some guidance/help in technology, development, crypto, or AI, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

Meanwhile, I definitely need help with marketing myself and what I build (I feel I am not so great at it) and also working out( I have never been a regular gym goer) I understand that we all are here because we are all risk-takers who are not afraid to try something new.

I feel that this experience will be transformative for each one of us.

I am excited to be around such a talented bunch of people and would love to talk and network with everyone here and learn from their journey.

I‚Äôm a DeFi power user.

I‚Äôm all about using cutting-edge onchain apps & infrastructure, understanding DeFi on a deep level, and educating others.

Since 2021 (just after defi summer), I‚Äôve been very active onchain.

The onchain economy was growing, so I left my big4 IT Risk job and joined a venture capital syndicate investing in early stage DeFi projects.

I built relationships with many of our LPs & became their go-to for everything onchain.

When the venture syndicate wound down, I doubled down on DeFi and built a company selling research.

We covered projects like Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Aave, Maker, GMX, Jupiter, Curve, and more.

Recently, I‚Äôve stepped back from that company, and my gf and I have been digital-nomad style traveling in SE Asia.

Skills I‚Äôm leveling up at NS (**learn**):

1. **Onchain data analysis**.

Extracting insights from onchain data.

2. **Financial analysis**.

Building financial models for digital assets.

3. **Programming**.

Building onchain apps, ensuring security, and plugging onchain data into financial models.

4. **Systems Design**.

Building sustainable, secure, and scalable onchain apps that minimize/eliminate governance risk.

5. **Content creation**.

Providing value beyond my existing client base, promoting NS builders and community members to the broader world, and helping educate others at scale to reduce onchain fraud, theft, and malinvestment.

My favorite **burn** activities are weightlifting and Muay Thai.

To anyone here who is not an onchain power users or developer: If you have any questions or want practical blockchain/DeFi knowledge feel free to reach out, tag me, or DM.

I love being useful to anyone who wants to use** onchain apps**.

There is no question to basic or silly.

I‚Äôm 26yrs old.

Born in Louisiana, raised in Alabama (rural states in the Southern USA üá∫üá∏ ).

Humbled to be here.

I‚Äôm in Da Nang, Vietnam until the NS starts.

My name is Esther, I‚Äôm a 30 year old from the Netherlands.

My background is in international law, I‚Äôve studied both human rights law and tax law.

Currently I‚Äôm working for a small international bank from the Netherlands where I am an international tax manager, mainly involved with the investment fund side of our company.

However, I‚Äôm looking to change my career to something else, although I‚Äôm not yet quite sure what exactly.

It is also still unclear whether I can continue this job remote, so I might have to quit (please tell me I‚Äôm not crazy) which I‚Äôll then see as the trigger to actually start something else.

On that note, I‚Äôve been learning to program, but I‚Äôm still on a very beginner level.

I am also interested in anything crypto, AI and web3, I‚Äôm definitely not an expert yet but I‚Äôve already learned quite a bit of the basics from my partner (who will join the NS as well!), and looking forward to keep learning about all this at the NS.

Outside of the work sphere I love travelling (just spend 6 months in South America), playing board games, learning new things, and I am a health enthusiast, following Blueprint for a while now.

Working out has been a constant throughout my life ‚Äì from playing field hockey on a decent level, to running several marathons, to doing multiple day hikes.

Anything active and I‚Äôm in!

Big believer in the future of crypto & web3. **My Goal** for entering the Network School to **learn**, **build new relationships** and **earn**.

I'm in a stage in my life where my sole goal is to level up.

To surround myself with the brightest minds and brainstorm then execute huge ideas.

I'm in a bit of a lull period where I'm preparing myself for the next crazy venture/business in my life.

I love creating content, and I will create a ""Network State Journey"" series documenting our daily lives, activities and experiences. **Fellow content creators** or those interested to start can absolutely join along on the ride here - just pm me.

Anyone looking to start their next big venture/business, I look forward to meeting and brainstorming.

G7) versus emerging non-Western (e.g.

I'm Colton, a jack of all trades mechanical engineer working in the HVAC/Plumbing side of the construction industry in the SF Bay area.

Stoked to meet you all and connect!

I've been playing with an idea similar to The Network State based on the idea of creating and decentralizing open-source blueprints for factories (ideally employee owned) that would manufacture (as autonomously as possible) products that would themselves automate (as much as possible) the handling of people's needs.

The idea being to give people on the ground the tools to come together and build the infrastructure to take care of themselves.

Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the foundational level covers Food, Water, & Shelter.

Then beyond that level: Health, Education, and Security.

So for example the solution set for ""shelter"" could look like a blueprint for a factory that cranks out unfolding shipping container houses.

My hobbies/interests include music (guitar, piano), travel (spent two years in Asia), amateur ancient history, survival skills, philosophy, spirituality, amateur biology, etc.

I don't know nearly enough about actually using the Blockchain, but I definitely appreciate a number of its potentials and can't wait to learn all about it.

My name is Sterlin.

I am a crypto OG.

I have been working professionally in the industry since 2015.

I got into crypto after being arrested back in 2009 for possession of MDMA.

This turned out to be a formative experience.

It taught me that the State is a wholly corrupted and debauched, and things need immediate overhaul.

It was this path that led me down an online rabbit hole.

Sometime in 2013 I came into contact with people calling themselves ""cypherpunks."" Those circles introduced me to bitcoin, and we were off to the races.

In this sense, I came into the space as an activist.

I wanted --- and still want --- to leverage crypto as a means for personal liberation and societal change.

I have had the opportunity to work directly with people like Roger Ver.

I was with bitcoin.com as a news writer, opinion page editor, and communications lead.

Then I worked in risk management for an OTC trading desk called Cryptospace.

And now I am working in the Network State ecosystem with Logos as a communications professional and writer for a year already.

I have spoken at dozens of cryptocurrency / tech conferences, have worked with some of the top players in the space, and seen unimaginable things.

I also wrote and published a book called ""Dignity & Decency: Rhapsodic Musings of a Modern Anarchist."" My wife and I have no children and are quasi-digitally nomadic.

I am here because I believe the network state is the path to realizing the vision of a more liberated humanity.

I cannot wait to meet you all, continue our shared education, and help enlighten the denizens of this planet for the sake of our future.

Our posterity counts on it.",discord

I'm Andrew.

I'm an ethical hacker, cybersecurity consultant and crypto enthusiast.

I stack sats and I run nodes for several projects.

The last few years I've been a full-time digital nomad, traveling between Chile, Peru, El Salvador and Mexico.

I'm anxious to begin the Asia part of my tour.

I'd like to help establish a blockchain security wing for the cybersecurity company that I work with the most.

I don't know enough about blockchain security and I hope to learn it here from some of you others. (There may be employment opportunity for you here even).

I'm also open to working with any startups on their overall cybersecurity practice.

It's also my dream to someday make a set of interconnected games on the blockchain, where the progress and outcomes of one game has ripple effects on the other games, where objects, characters and skills can be transferred back and forth, and ultimately where players can create a marketplace of mods and get paid directly by their fans for their work.

I'm a member of Neo Tokyo DAO, but with all my competing priorities, the video games part of my life always falls to the bottom.

I am so excited to meet all of you!",discord

I discovered Balaji's 1729 community after leaving big tech out of boredom, and it's been life-changing.

Since then, I've been deep in crypto, currently working at Flashbots, where we solve MEV problems and build Ethereum infrastructure like MEV-Boost.

We're also exploring hardware-based solutions like TEE for credible and confidential computing (same tech used for Apple Intelligence).

On the side, I invest in and advise startups and funds in the space.

My Network School goal is to step back and refocus on the big questions.

I'm at a ""mid-life crisis"" point as a crypto builder, seeing how much of the space has drifted from the original crypto spirit.

Some key concerns I have include: 1.

Centralization Creep: Growing influence of institutional players (e.g., ETFs) potentially centralizing power and increasing vulnerability to attacks. 2.

Speculative Casino Culture: Influx of opportunists and scammers across all levels, turning the industry into a speculative playground‚Äîwhere the yield/return comes from. 3.

Self-Regulation Failure: Industry's struggle to self-regulate and prevent bad actors from hijacking the movement, exposing limitations of libertarian ideals. 4.

Hype Over Substance: Prevalence of shallow, overhyped projects optimized for impressing retails and quick exits rather than creating real impact or sustainable business/protocol, fostering a culture of pseudo-profound but ultimately meaningless innovations.

Balaji's clear big-picture thinking was what I loved most about

1729. (I often joke he's our era's Hari Seldon, while I'm still the clueless encyclopedist ‚Äì Foundation fans will get it.) I'm here to: 1.

Find my own answers to the big questions about crypto as an industry and movement 2.

Get a clearer picture of our current world 3.

These massive reptiles, capable of growing over 6 meters (20 feet) long, are found in Singapore‚Äôs coastal waters, mangroves, and estuaries.

Places like Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Kranji Reservoir, and the coastal areas around Pulau Ubin are known spots where they‚Äôve been sighted.

They‚Äôre not super common, though‚ÄîSingapore‚Äôs urban environment limits their presence, and there are likely only a small number around, possibly stragglers from larger populations in nearby Malaysia or Indonesia.

Here in the Philippines, we have the SRRV program (Special Retiree Resident Visa) and SIRV program (Special Investor Resident Visa), which are similar but less expensive (no property requirement, although money remitted into the program could be used for future condo purchases).

The SRRV and SIRV programs allow participants to be eligible to work for a local company (although a separate work permit application is required, the work permit will not need to be tied to a work-visa, which is usually harder to get).

The Malaysian MMH2 program also allows one to work for a local company with additional work permit, with added benefit that those over 50 do not need to get work permit.",discord

The main gist is just that I think it's a missed opportunity to not have a simpler (and optionally anonymous) way to send feedback.

In terms of figuring out the right channel for the right feedback, y'all have said that `/feedback` submissions are more likely to be prioritized if there is similar feedback coming from more than one person.

So I've wanted to default to posting there over sending a DM (especially if it's not urgent) to help the team's prioritization process and avoid blowing up your DMs.",discord

I'll DM you to understand what feedback you wanted to share so we can understand (1) what the right channel is and (2) potential ways to reduce friction.

Meanwhile, I'll highlight two other avenues: - Message any NS Core staff member on Discord or talk to us irl to share feedback - Complete ns.com/fixit for maintenance requests We review responses to ns.com/feedback periodically but as I mentioned above you can always share feedback with NS Core staff if it's time sensitive or critical to relay directly.",discord

But I wish I could submit feedback without being required to **1.** give an NPS score **2.** input decisions about staying at NS past Dec 23 and **3.** provide an email.

When I provide an NPS score and ""past Dec 23rd"" decision, I feel like it seems like those data points are the most important part of the submission.

However, every time I've filled this form out, I've wanted the focus to be on the feedback itself (not NPS score).

I don't think this is your intention, but I think it's also easy to start wondering if the feedback is only considered based on how you score the NPS and how you mark the ""past Dec 23rd"" question.

If y'all are doing a Superhuman-style PMF-metric on the feedback and that's why you're collecting this, I get it.

But, as a community member, it just feels like a lot to categorize myself this way when I want to share feedback. **The net result is friction to using `/feedback`**.

Also, I'm sure you're missing out on valuable feedback from folks by requiring an email address to submit the form.

I can understand the pros-and-cons of allowing anonymous feedback, but I think there's important signal you're not getting because of this. **Again, the net result is friction to using `/feedback`**.

As a last note ‚Äî it would be great to know if y'all actually have the bandwidth to regularly review `/feedback` at the moment.

It would be fine if the honest answer was ""no"", but would be good to know and set expectations.",discord

It was discussed at length around the 2014s by the ethereum community (vitalik made a blogpost about it) and other great minds (raph merkle wrote a pice on it) but it only got implemented for the first time around eoy 2023.

We were lucky to participate in the birth and early contribution of the project, we are very passionate about this.

If that's something that could interest some of you, let us know!

Bet on value, trade on belief: https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html In this blogpost, Hanson argues that we should bet on value (set goals) but use markets to find the most efficient way to achieve these goals.

Futarchy is a paradigm shift for governance and imo the most interesting experiment happening rn in crypto üî•",discord

Lead time for Blueprint products when ordering to Malaysia is now 3-5 days.

Network School students have a 10% discount (code: NetworkSchool10).

Apply the code at checkout. (2) *Disclaimer*: Our team encountered issues with Blueprint Protein Powder and are having to remake it.

So, the website will not allow you to buy it at the moment, but you can join the waitlist (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/protein?variant=48973070795037).

Otherwise, for protein options, you can purchase the Nutty Pudding Mix (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/nutty-pudding-protein-mix), and we'll be launching a Macadamia Protein Bar soon (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/macadamia-protein-bar?variant=49185238745373). (3) Talked with our ops team, and at the moment, it's much better to do individual orders than group orders.

This is the v1 way to have Blueprint products at the Network School.

Future iterations plan on having easier options and allowing for buying on-site.

Will keep everyone in the loop for that. (4) Action Item: each of you should do the following... 1.

Visit the Blueprint website: https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/. 2.

Add any / all items to cart you'd like (besides Blueprint Protein). 3.

Go to checkout and apply the 'NetworkSchool10' discount code for 10% off. *Delivery address:* Address: Forest City Marina Hotel, Jalan Forest City 1, Pulau Satu State: Johor, City: Gelang Patah, Postcode: 81550 DM me if you have any questions.",discord

Individual nfts have traded for hundreds of thousands and there's thousands of active players.

It moved from eth L1 to Stark net and saw massive reduction in gas fees, improved speed and allowed them to introduce a whole new micro stakes level of play.

Previously 1/100 cards would cost a min of $500+ to build a basic team and start playing but once they moved to Stark net they introduced a new 1/1000 rarity meaning anybody could get started playing with $50 for a basic team.

It's a great bit of tech I'm looking forward to the talk.

My flight is to and from Singapore like many of you.

I am also only staying for a few weeks (and not for 3 months, unfortunately).

In the arrival form, I'm assuming you are mentioning the exit date as 23rd Sep (instead of the date of the flight back from Singapore)?

So if you're arriving on Sept 23, you can fill the Arrival Cards after Sept 20.

For Singapore Arrival Card, most people will fall into the foreign visitor category.

LTVP (long term visitor pass) is has very specific requirements that you can check here: https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/LTVP.

For Malaysia DAC, you can fill in your best guess if you aren't certain of some details (e.g. date of departure).

However, you should ensure that the details are valid based on your visa requirements.

E.g. as a US citizen, you get 90 days visa-free, so your date of departure should be within 90 days of the date of entry.

Are we supposed to put down a bus number that will be given to us by admins since I plan on using the Network School Bus to get in Malaysia?

I arrived by plane to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Sunday.

Where the online form asked for my onward ticket, I chose LAND and just put bus ticket a2345.

When immigration asked how long I'd stay, I told them I would stay 2 weeks because I plan to go Singapore by land for conference.

They said ""okay üëç"" and gave me a 90 day stamp.

They didn't actually care about an onward ticket.

They gave me 90 days automatically, even with the assumption that I'd be leaving in 2 weeks.

I say that to say that it was very easy and hassle-free, they were welcoming.

YMMV, but if you were stressing about it, can relax.

Just fill out your arrival info online anytime before walking up to immigration counter, preferably before flight",discord

I expect a few things to be not be as streamlined as this has not been done before. # Accommodation Appears to be a hotel.

Pros: no need for cleaning, gym access, pool?

Cons: no amenities useful for longer stay (laundry, cooking / food storage) Fine with me as included in the whole price and want to keep the team doing what they can.

I expect to provide some additional budget to augment the experience. # Food I've worked with a nutrionist for 3 months this year to get me ready for a sport event.

Lost 14 kg while eating healthy and much more consistently.

Process included tracking everything I ate or cooked in myfitnesspal app to understand if I hit macros and calories.

My fitness age is -5 years my biological age (Garmin watch data).

Wasn't fun eating like this, but will do that again when at Network School (accountability buddies welcome).

I am not vegan but am looking forward to do the blue print experiment.

Main concern is that I need my proteins and don't like to have them from powders. # Laundry If hotel laundry then pricey.

Also prefer to have my own laundry vs. delegating that.

Asia usually has good laundry services but I could not find any so far for Forest City.",discord

For people that are traveling to Singapore just for the conference, ""business"" might be more appropriate.

Ultimately, the motive depends on your plans and is highly context dependent.

Network School will be in on an island that's part of Malaysia.

So you can use Forest City as the address for your Malaysia DAC (Digital Arrival Card) or visa application.

For Singapore visa, you should use the hotel you plan on staying in.",discord

Now we're going to have a business hackathon, where we you will learn first hand how to scale a business from making a few dollars to $1000s to $10,000s per month.

We will get first hand guidance from <@778466317354532865> on how to do this!

During the business hackathon businesses will compete and the business that earns that most revenue will will a price.

On Monday at 4pm (after the lecture) we will have an info session in the ping pong room where you can learn more!",discord

I‚Äôm exploring options for getting a cold plunge, and I found PolarPro by Polar‚Äîa top-of-the-line model offering great value at $2,200 USD. https://polarplungemy.com/products/polarpro Given the benefits of cold exposure for recovery, focus, and overall well-being, I thought it could be cool (literally ‚ùÑÔ∏è) to co-own one as a group!

Would anyone be interested in contributing and sharing ownership?

This would allow us to split the cost, set up a fair usage system, and make cold plunging more accessible for the community.

What's a time series?

First, a time series is just a bunch of numbers that come one after another over time - like if you wrote down the temperature every day for a whole year, or how many customers visited a store each hour.

What did these scientists create?

They created something called ""Sundial,"" which is like a super-smart computer program that can look at any time series (like temperatures, sales, or website visitors) and predict what might happen next!

Why is it special?

It learns from TONS of data - they trained it on 1 trillion numbers from all sorts of time series!

It doesn't just give one prediction - it gives several possible futures because the future isn't certain It works right away - you don't need to train it specially for your particular data How does it work?

They created a special way for the computer to learn called ""TimeFlow Loss."" This helps the computer understand patterns in numbers that change over time.

It's a bit like how your brain might notice that after it rains, the temperature usually drops - but way more complicated!

They use something called a ""Transformer"" (similar to what powers AI like ChatGPT), but they made special changes to make it work better with time series data.

What can it do?

Sundial can: Predict energy usage Forecast weather patterns Guess future sales And lots more!

The coolest part is that when they tested it against other prediction programs, Sundial did better than almost all of them - even though the other programs had to be specially trained for each specific prediction task!

Why does this matter?

Imagine if you're planning how much electricity your city needs next week, or how many ice cream cones to make at your shop tomorrow.

Having good predictions helps you make better decisions.

And since Sundial shows you several possible futures (not just one), you can better prepare for different possibilities!",discord

Generate a unique qr programmatically that is associated with a customer id, payment amount, and chain.

This QR can be used to do a normal crypto payment. 2.

When transaction succeeds fire a webhook I can listen to that gives me all transaction details and that customer id. 3.

Provide a dashboard (simple table) with all transaction details and customer id as each row.

Allow me to export as csv.

Warplet could be used as a token for voting, but instead of just selecting the top meme for launch (which often follows the usual pattern of just bleeding), we could introduce betting on specific metrics for well-known meme tokens.

For example: - Which meme token will have the highest 24h volume? - Which one will experience the least drop in price?

Sam here!üëã Welcome to our 4-part series on China‚Äîa country with a past as rich as its ambitions for the future.

From ancient philosophies and revolutionary politics to cutting-edge tech and global trade, China‚Äôs story is as complex as it is influential.

There‚Äôs a lot of noise and half-truths out there about China.

My goal with this series is to cut through the confusion and dive into what really drives this nation.

We‚Äôll be exploring four key themes‚Äîhistory, culture, politics, and economics‚Äîto get a clear view of what‚Äôs happening behind the headlines.

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at what we‚Äôll cover: üìú History: How We Got Here üìö Culture: The Roots and Realities üèõ Politics: Who Runs the Show and How üìä Economics: The Engine Behind the Dragon So, if you‚Äôre ready to move past the headlines and really understand what makes China tick‚Äîwithout getting lost in translation‚Äîstick around.

This is going to be one fascinating journey! https://lu.ma/e2xd39q5",discord

But staying consistent is hard.

Personally, I want to grow my X, kick off interview series, start sharing my thoughts within the Network School and beyond.

But without a system, it‚Äôs easy to push writing aside.

I thought it would be helpful to shape a new habit and support each other in a group.

Here is the idea of writing routine ¬´Morning pages¬ª: a space to write together, a couple of times per week.

Just 30-40 minutes of focused writing ‚Äì whether it's a tweet, a Substack post, or even a movie scenario.

And ideally a finished post by the end.

But there‚Äôs Bitcoin, and then there‚Äôs crypto.

This move hands centralized shitcoiners the power to print U.S. government fiat, completely missing the point of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin exists to defund and shift power away from the Federal Reserve, not to create a new class of digital central bankers.

XRP has always been a joke‚Äîdumping coins on holders‚Äînow they get to print fiat, diluting both U.S. government reserves and taxpayers‚Äô holdings.

Why hand this power to shitcoiners?

The Bybit hack proves ETH is an overcomplicated, insecure mess.

Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need the U.S. government‚Äîthe U.S. government needs BTC as a store of value.

Mixing BTC‚Äôs role with crypto nonsense only adds unnecessary risk.

There is no second best.

When the shitcoiners get greedy or hacked, this whole experiment will collapse, jeopardizing BTC adoption.

And when North Korea inevitably hacks the U.S. government's ETH multi-sig, what‚Äôs stopping Elizabeth Warren from liquidating everything and setting Bitcoin adoption back years?",discord

I think one of the differences is that we can **develop business **in the network state.

The state has its own GDP while Hilton only has its own operating income.

Hilton members are just consumers, while **NS citizens can also be producers**.

The network state also mentioned that fiat countries can often tamper with history, but population or data statistics through blockchain cannot be tampered with.

So I have an idea to **count NS‚Äôs GDP and create GDP on it.** <@889423182031900672> counted the current GDP(onchain part).

I really hope to discuss how to increase NS‚Äôs GDP and write the business development history of NS together.

Maybe start by selling/buying a mango with crypto at Marina hotel and displaying the GDP of NS members in real time.",discord

I'm thinking of submitting an event for recurring learning circles ‚Äì small, focused sessions (7-10 people max) to tackle real-world problem statements.

Wanted to gauge interest first.

Imagine: you bring a challenge/problem statement you're working on, we pre-share it so folks interested in the problem statement sign up, and then spend an hour brainstorming solutions together.

You'd kick things off with a quick 10-minute context overview, followed by 50 minutes of collaborative problem-solving.

Please vote with üëç if you have problem statements like this that would benefit from brainstorming, and vote with üíØ if you'd be excited to join the brainstorming sessions.",discord

Besides sheer bafflement, I have experienced scorn, contempt, and a host of other reactions that are not repeatable here.

We need a way to explain the concept to millions.

Beyond that, we need to make it plausible to people who are not like you and me.

Let‚Äôs pitch a movie or a streaming series to the producers!

A reasonable one or two month project for the Network School would be to develop the dramatic elements for at least a treatment, if not a draft of a pilot show.

At the end, we should be able to pitch to producers in Hollywood and elsewhere.

We could possibly even crowdfund a stipend for a brand-name director or screenwriter to help us scaffold to a first-rate script.

For All Mankind (TV series) - Wikipedia is a good model for poli-fi (political science fiction) that starts with a simple premise and imagines a different world.

We could imagine a great show!

It should be on a voluntary basis, like with an airline loyalty rewards program.

Tying visa status/‚Äú# days allowed to stay‚Äù uniformly based on a nation-state passport is arguably an inefficient concept.

That‚Äôs bureaucracy, not meritocracy. **Thesis: If airlines could offer frequent flyer programs, and credit cards could offer rewards programs, and certain countries are already offering Gold Visas for high net worth individuals, nation states should offer frequent visitors/tourists/digital nomads ‚Äúa rewards point system‚Äù based on $ spent inside their borders. ** The nation state rewards tourists/frequent travelers/digital nomads with points based on $ spent; high point totals could translate into visa-free status/higher # days stay status and other perks.

Was travelling around with friends.

I got Malay eSIM (https://maya.net), worked well, had connectivity across all of Malaysia, with decent speed.

There's also https://www.airalo.com that I tried in Vietnam.

My friend got a SIM from one of largest providers from airport itself.

That costed half as compared to mine, and had unlimited data(vs fixed 20GB of Maya).

But his physical sim wasn't reliable at all.

Super slow speeds.

Had to use WiFi all the time.

Ideally it is a flight ticket leaving the country (most convenient are services like onwardticket.com or sth. cheaper is booking fully-refundable flights), it could be a train/bus/<anything> ticket leaving the country via it¬¥s landside border, or even a hotel reservation.

But it always kinda depends on the person that is checking, what they accept.

During my time traveling, I once wanted to use a bus ticket and had to discuss it with the airline (first, they did not want to accept it and deny boarding).

Since then, I just always booked an onward flight (which I cancelled for a full refund after immigration) because it is always accepted.",discord

I don‚Äôt have many people to talk to about these topics, and they‚Äôre always sooo interesting.

Balaji‚Äôs tweets are packed with information, often so dense that parts of it go over my head.

I also rarely get to hear the other side of them and especially from people that have thought about such topics in depth.

Most of the people who disagree with him on Twitter seem more interested in arguing than engaging in an honest discussion.

So, I figured this thread could be a space where we break down his tweets whenever he posts.

I imagine many of you here would also be interested in these discussions.

In the spirit of discussion...

Neter, Mili, and I had a discussion on a similar topic during one of the breakfasts.

There were both tech optimistic and dystopian views.

Tech optimist ‚Äî AI could create abundance by liberating humans to chase self-actualizing dreams, unleash new creativity, etc etc Ultra tech optimist ‚Äî AI could fuse with humans to form human-machine hybrids in some trans-humanist future Dystopian ‚Äî AI could be centralized in the hands of few oligarchs or nation states who control narrative while the masses, freed from needing to produce, indulge in endless entertainment fantasies enabled by AI (Playstation -> TikTok -> AI enabled entertainment) Regarding silicon intelligence, there is arguably another form.

Our current known biology and biological intelligence stem from carbon-based organic chemistry.

Carbon, with four valence electrons that facilitate bonding, serves as a basis framework for known life on Earth-like environments.

The next element further down the periodic table with four valence electrons is silicon.

Suppose somewhere in the universe, under a very different and more extreme climate or environment, it is silicon, not carbon, that serves as a basis framework for life and intelligent life?

Silicon-based lifeforms and alien intelligence.",discord

Today is Chinese New Year's Eve, the night before the Lunar New Year celebrations begin.

On this special occasion, Chinese families gather for reunion dinners, set off firecrackers, and put up Spring Festival couplets to welcome the new year üéä .

According to the Chinese lunar calendar, this is the Year of the Snakeüêç.

In the Five-Element theory (Wuxing), ""Yi"" corresponds to the Wood element, which is associated with spring and symbolizes vitality and renewal.

As we enter the Yisi year (the cyclical designation for 2025), the prevailing Wood energy brings a sense of springtime rejuvenation, as if the world is being draped in fresh greenery.

In Chinese culture, the snake embodies wisdom, mystery, and transformative power, while also representing adaptability in the face of change.

This suggests that both our external environment and personal circumstances may undergo significant transformations in the coming year.

As we embrace the Year of the Snakeüêç, I wish y'all inspired creativity, graceful transitions, and delightful discoveries throughout this dynamic period.

May your new year be filled with prosperity and joy!",discord

Things are so wild...I can't help but continue to join this discussion in the ""discussion"" group.

Hope there is more constructive discussion and debate.

Trump has arguably been doing some really good things for American people who prefer less federal government overreach, and his administration is very much more preferable for pro-tech, pro-crypto, and libertarians in America.

That said...this is wild.

Trump could have had potential to win a Nobel Peaze Prize, instead of alienating Europe, slapping fellow North American neighbors with 25% tariffs (there are only two other big North American neighbors!), and now antagonizing significant Latin American nation states.

At least Spain (in the name of God), Britain (bringing 'civilization') had created surface level narratives for imperialist / colonial expansion...as opposed to blatant takeover rhetoric (Greenland, Panama, Canada).

The rest of the world won't just roll over....even if certain far-right politicians in some countries favor Trump, their voters will likely vote ""XYZ is not for sale!"" For pro-tech and freedom-loving Americans - Trump could be good.

For USA the nation state - Could be scoring own-goals.

A nation state with significantly-higher-than-global median age, ~4% global population and 15% of global GDP adjusting for PPP probably cannot afford increasing divisions at home and alienating allies, partners, Global South, and competitors all at once abroad.

Would love to hear comments and discussions on Reza's ask.

One early hypothesis of a post-US financial order (one of many potential views) could be going back to the 1870's - 1890's (so no order actually): 1870's - 1890's USA: Rise of oligarchs, expansion of domestic manufacturing and industry, increasing exploitation/banishment of immigrants, continued expansion of new frontiers. 1870's - 1890's world: Increasing inequalities, mercantilism, great power games, rampant unchecked colonialism, and rapid tech advancements.

Post-2025 USA: Dominance of tech oligarchs, return of domestic manufacturing, curbs on immigrations, expansion of tech frontiers.

Post-2025 world: Increasing global inequalities, erosion of international bodies toward more mercantilism, great superpower games (and possibly Bitcoin being a part of power games to stockpile), unchecked power grabs by various ascending powers, and rapid tech advancements.",discord

To build on the discussion on shaping of narratives...

Arguably, one of the key reasons for Tiktok ban in the US is that the establishment is unable to shape narratives on TikTok.

To borrow a Balaji term -- it doesn't have root control over TikTok.

Arguably, the Great Firewall of the East was also erected in part to stabilize narratives.

Though there is a technical difference: if a tech company complies with Chinese laws, it can operate inside the wall (whether those laws are perceived as stringent is a different discussion).

Many Western tech giants made a conscious decision to stay outside the wall.

In TikTok's situation, it has made efforts to comply with US laws (whether those efforts are perceived as sufficient is a different discussion), while the establishment made a conscious decision to ban/force sale regardless.

Whether it is firewall or ban/ejection/forced sale, the action creates a digital barrier to make it easier to shape/enforce mainstream narratives.

But time and time again, we see that the network's organic, grassroots strength could prevail.

What makes the recent situation interesting is the direction of flow...it's as if the East German establishment originally made the wall, but the West Germans are so fed up with ""West German"" propaganda that they break the wall and go to East Germany this time (and find that ""East Germany"" is actually in some ways wealthier).

For a moment in time, there is a conjuring of that image where East Germans and West Germans celebrate a common humanity without artificial barriers or enforced narratives from either side's propaganda.

The issue of how narratives are shaped is arguably very relevant to NS and network society movement.

We are already seeing a relatively negative mainstream narrative (for example, previous BBC article, etc) that is being slapped onto us.

Reading that BBC article, it almost feels like a mainstream narrative was already pre-determined to be slapped on -- in that vein, it was arguably smart for the NS group to not engage with mainstream media too early and to not play their game with their rules.

Digital barriers make it easier for those negative mainstream narratives to stick longer.

But the organic, grassroots power of the network would prevail eventually.

Interesting observations Mili made regarding various popups.

As with the crypto movement, there is going to be diversity: BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.

We have Balaji + NS (BTC), Vitalik + Zuzalu (ETH), etc.

Then at some point, we have the memecoin equivalents for network societies/popups?",discord

NS was much more BTC, right & money vibes whereas all other zuvillages I've been too are ETH, left & impact vibes.

Balaji had previously during his lecture astutely made an insight about history being in reverse.

Here is another recent example: In the 1950's and 1960's, the East erected and guarded a wall in Berlin against supposed Western influence, while thousands of people from the East tried to flee and seek refuge in the West by breaking through that wall.

In the Internet era, a Great Firewall also exists, while it is the West that is now becoming increasingly concerned about alleged Eastern influence (e.g. recent TikTok ban), and hundreds of thousands of Internet users from the West (especially Americans) are now organically trying to flock to the Internet of the East through apps like Xiaohongshu / RedNote (which ironically is literally named after ""The Little Red Book"" of communist origin).

Times change.

There is a breaking the ""Berlin Wall"" potential to this Xiaohongshu / RedNote development.

Few people saw this coming.

People are wondering how long this organic network-driven breaking of digital barriers erected by nation states could last.

If it lasts, there could be major lessons and takeaways for the network society movement. https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1879459953112645773",discord

It can be frustrating since big social media giants have hundreds of millions of users and not enough (or any!) customer support.

One tactic I have found useful in the past is Linkedin: search for profile of someone high up in the totem pole at a social media tech giant (not the CEO, but someone in the director level who oversees a lot of customer service or customer-related operations), connect and message, that way you bypass the seemingly impossible customer service gap.",discord

I always thought the saying, ‚ÄúShow me who you‚Äôre with, and I‚Äôll tell you who you are,‚Äù was just that‚Äîa saying.

But the past few months at the Network School have completely changed my perspective.

Meeting brilliant people from all over the world has shown me just how true this saying is.

I feel like I‚Äôve gained so much insight and wisdom and have become a better version of myself.

Being around kind, intelligent, and hardworking people truly transforms you, and I can confidently confirm this from my own experience.

I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the opportunity to call such amazing people my friends and to have had the chance to learn and absorb so much knowledge and wisdom.

A huge thank you to everyone who‚Äôs made this experience so magical.

A big thanks to Balaji as well as Jackson, Donovan, Jonny, Jacob, Yash, etc the NS organizers; to Boonsri for organizing Startup Kids‚Äô Club; and to 150 incredibly talented v1 NS members for an amazing living community and meaningful conversations!

Will respect the vision Balaji has in mind for the future.

After applying to NS, I initially could only make logistics work during first two weeks after Network State Conference, but really missed this, so came back for the full last month after finally making logistics work.

Probably many of us would hope that this is a beginning of journey and not an end‚Ä¶and we would love to come back for v2 to continue contributing to a part of the collective journey as NS scales from 100 to 1000 to 10000 and more.

We are all also online and in the cloud.

The end of v1 doesn‚Äôt mean the end of this community or our discussions.

Hoping we continue to stay in touch on Discord and via online conversations, etc.

The movement is also multi-generational.

It was really good to see kids coming in.

Thank you Electrik Dreams for our kids‚Äô wonderful playdate.

I wanted the young son to be exposed at a very early age to new paradigms.

Hopefully we will have a future generation of Netizens.

It was a memorable and magical time surrounded by such drive, ambition, learning, curiosities and variety, and filled with growth and gainz.

Even a v2 will not compare to the magic of 150 curious smart people aping into the unknown.

I welcome a v2 but can‚Äôt help but feel this first 3 months will be something we will not quite recreate.

It‚Äôs like how Bitcoin can‚Äôt be recreated because of expectations from prior art.

As a nomad, I felt like a sense of home had been created and a base had been formed.

I am considering coming back to SG/MY some time in January and continuing the nomad life.

Either testing out a Singapore base, returning to my first nomad destination (KL), or a v2 (bring it on).

A social directory and travel app for nomads.

This was a substack feed via email from Alex Svetski: Social 2.0 - The future of the connected web futuresocial@substack.com Succeeding where FourSquare failed What is this ""Satlantis"" thing?

A social network?

A directory?

A super app?

ALEKSANDAR SVETSKI DEC 20 2024 How & where it all started: In 2023, I was working on The Spirit of Satoshi - a Bitcoin centric LLM that we built our own dataset for and then trained, along with basic RLHF tools (with lightning payouts).

We must have trained at least 30 models, maybe more.

By the end of the year, I concluded that even though we started to generate some revenue, there wasn‚Äôt really a serious business there.

At least not a startup worth investing capital into and scaling.

Around the same time, a seed of another idea had been planted in my mind via two small events. 1.

A friend reached out on Telegram asking if we could train some sort of AI on all the bitcoin-friendly locations around the world to act as a bitcoin-travel-assistant. 2.

My wife and I were in Salvador trying to find a good coffee place, and all the high-rated places on Google sucked.

We only found a place thanks to a word of mouth referral.

Robert, (the same friend who reached out to me on Telegram) and I bumped into each other in Salvador, and we realised that the AI assistant was the wrong UX.

We figured that people need something more visual.

Something more like‚Ä¶.NomadList.

This led us to the originally idea which we not-so-creatively called: ‚ÄúBitcoin NomadList.‚Äù We adapted the idea over a few iterations into a sort of social network for bitcoiners and nomads called ‚ÄúSatlantis.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ S stands for Sovereign.

So Satlantis = Sovereign Atlantis, or the ‚Äúpromised land‚Äù for Sovereign Individuals.

Satlantis aims to be a super app for nomads, bitcoiners, remote workers, and sovereign individuals, combining features of NomadList, Meetup, Instagram and TripAdvisor TBC in thread",discord

It's epic. 100mb down/20 up in areas with really crap roaming or 4g (that's the ""first world of Western Europe"").

No subscription, you just pay the monthly fee (which is for the whole continent) when you need it.

Yes, it would fit into a carry on/backpack.

The good thing is that it has everything integrated: wlan router.

It takes like 40-50 watts so you can use a strong USB-C charging plug for it or even a powerbank.

There is, I think, no official support for the USB-C to the powerplug it needs.

I haven't fixed that yet but it would allow you to use a charger you may already have.

So the white power supply unit is not necessarily needed to carry around.",discord

Traditional Bitcoin transactions operate on a simple transfer system, but sBTC introduces smart contract capabilities while maintaining Bitcoin's security model."" (excited to build my dapp/DAO with bridged btc instead of a token) From @danheld: This is a big step forward in utilizing a more securely bridged Bitcoin on the L2 üëè Bridged Bitcoin is the Bitcoin that you use on a Bitcoin L2, and how securely that Bitcoin is bridged over matters greatly for defi usage on the L2.

For those who don't know, sBTC is 1:1 pegged to Bitcoin.

This means for every sBTC created, there‚Äôs an equal amount of Bitcoin securely locked to back it.

When you mint sBTC, you send BTC into a secure system.

The BTC is unlocked and returned to you when you redeem. sBTC is secured by the largest pool of signers/validators in an open membership network.

And anyone can join this pool of signers.

Note that they are capping initial deposits at 1,000 BTC because they want to make sure everything is working properly, which means there could be risks/a few kinks to iron out.

NS has been transformational.

Being around smart, unapologetically unique, and self-driven group of people turned out to be one of the best experiences ever.

I leave knowing it will be hard to live like this elsewhere.

Thinking of how many promising trajectories were in the batch made me realise that maybe we'll look back at these photos and think they were not that different .

Thanks <@777003807279677500> for taking this bet, and for making something so different feel so obvious.

And a big thank you to the NS team‚Äîyou created a home where belonging felt natural for people who don‚Äôt often feel like we belong anywhere.

Go to new places and try to uncover as much of the map as possible.

There are rankings and stuff.

Quite addictive -Send stickers to your friends -notifies you if your friends just entered a new country Drawback: -you share your location data with your friends and the french company that runs the servers.

But you can turn it off selectively (if you go to a strip club or some such place) What I like most is that the app removes the ""overhead/chore"" of asking your friends where they are and meeting up.

Sometimes, my friends just come to me spontaneously or I come to them.

Privacy is important but I trade it away for something that gives me value.

I wanted to express my full gratitute to each and everyone that I got to meet - this group of people is truly special and made me feel at home, far far away from it.

To be able to be surrounded by progressive-critical, techno-optimists made me feel like I found my new tribe.

The idea is ambitious, but in my eyes wether or not the NS evolves how it's currently planned to evolve, for me it has already been an astounding success, because of the people and the community.

We're all straight fucking nuts lmao. moving to Malaysia on a whim is a pretty baller move.

I'm proud for all of us to having said yes to this.

Godspeed to the entire NS team and each and everyones personal endeavors.

I sure hope to come back next week.

India is even arguably more diverse and larger.

Yes, Balaji has said many good insights as well on related topics.

There had been analogies of the parallel societies movement as an open-source ""Linux"" to the existing sparring ""Windows"" and ""OSX"".

Given how fast things are moving, and what 20th century history has taught us, probably no one wants to end up being a part of a ""1930's like"" statistic. **If this discussion gets too long, maybe we open a thread?

One reason Systems Theory and Game Theory rose to prominence in the Cold War (on both sides) is that they offered a pathway for making sense- ‚Äògetting a handle on‚Äô- circumstances and events that are super difficult to grasp without a methodology of abstraction.

Otherwise, As Nation-States premised on highly centralized organizational structure, the flood of data & information, etc becomes all noise.

Respecting that people in NS have many ties to many countries and places‚Äî and presumably would prefer World Powers find a way to get along‚Äî we might benefit from considering the Non-aligned Movement from the Cold War (iirc Balaji discusses this in the book).

The NAM contributed to the establishment of new governments and states (recognizing sovereignty), creating a pathway for legitimacy that didn‚Äôt depend on an USSR/USA dichotomy.

De-centralization of the centers of power contributed to reduction in tensions, dialog between the super powers, and global moral legitimacy increasing in importance‚Ä¶.

Especially as television spread around the world.

Lots of parallels to be found.",discord

Dalio‚Äôs perspectives are arguably insightful (** also acknowledging that the Dalio post is just one perspective and may/or may not play out exactly.).

This is arguably good for US domestically (~4% of world population), but could be somewhat unsettling from international perspective. 1 - Arguably not good for digital nomads in terms of fragmented world. (What if COVID travel restrictions are precursor of what may yet to come?) 2 - Arguably not good for Asia-Pacific in terms of stability.

Escalated conflict centered on region with ~60% of world population, > 60% of trade, possibly > 60% of armaments and deployable military power could be frightening.

Escalated hot US-China war could trigger blockade and counter-move in Strait of Malacca.

Arguably not good for Forest City and Singapore.

Problem of dumping China with N.

Korea/Iran/Venezuela etc is that China (like India) is a subcontinent with population equal to that of US + EU + SE Asia combined and biggest tradiing partner in most emerging economies ‚Äî the ripple effects would be vast.

If you are raising a family, you arguably don‚Äôt want to be raising it in the 1930‚Äôs (the analogy that Dalio gives).

Open question - how could network societies cushion the blow for potentially thousands and millions in a hypothetical 1930‚Äôs scenario?

Beyond tech and crypto libertarianism, could this trigger further scaling opportunities for the parallel society movement? - Potentially millions of migrants and refugees who don‚Äôt want to return to their damaged home countries but are shunned/deported/blocked by developed countries that are now anti-immigration/trending right. (What percentage of illegals/migrants are criminals vs. honest families just trying to build better lives for themselves and their families?) - Potentially hundreds of thousands of people with families who are spread between Western and non-Western countries.

The Americans living in Beijing or Shanghai or Shenzhen, the Chinese-Americans in Texas, the Iranian-Americans in Florida, the Taiwanese who just want to get on with their lives without planes buzzing on top, the Filipinos who worry about South China Sea escalations, the Singaporeans who have investments in both US and China, etc?",discord

As some of you know I've pivoted my startup to build AI tools, specifically highly automated AI agents that produce media content.

Eventually, once I work out all the bugs, you'll be able to launch your own copies of these agents I'm building, with your parameters.

The first AI agent I'm launching as a demo is a Low-Fi beats music generator, which livestreams on your channels.

The software stack, for those curious, is suno+OBS+VLC+restream in a docker container with some Rust to glue it all together.

You should be able to tune into the demo stream here, give it a listen and let me know any feedback: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYYVSepvEVU",discord

Night owl here.

Some of you already came to the event I hosted last week, so sorry for spamming again.

The event (""Shoot your Short"") was for those of us that want to create Shorts for the NS Bounties but don't have lots of time.

In the event I presented a tool I've been building since we arrived at NS, and today I finally deployed it --> https://longstories.ai üéâ For those of you that couldn't come to the event but still want to submit a Short for your bounty, here you have a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/12e050efd86a4bef99c38b33a6f5232a?sid=d7d90391-9b72-4919-ab69-c5d9ad8d9b84.

As an extra motivation: - You don't need to pay anything to use it.

It's in beta, and it's free (although I'm paying for the tokens so if you want to contribute there's a stripe link :P) - As an extra, I created a tool that automates the writing of the ""Readme"" that you need to submit a bounty (the video explains how that works).

So if you make a video with it, you don't need to worry about that part!

Attached a few of the videos I created with the app.

Let me know if you create videos with it, I'd love to see!",discord

Unfortunately, I was just recalled home by my day job (today American time) - it was either come back pronto and catch an onsite project, or take a leave of absence that I can't currently afford.

As a result, I changed my flight and will now be leaving on Sunday.

It has been an incredible experience being here with you all - life-changing, in fact.

I'm more healthy, more inspired, and more enthusiastic than I have been in a very long time, and I cherish this time, this opportunity, and the chance I've had to get to know you all.

Please all do keep in touch or reach out - I'd love to stay in contact with you!

If you're ever in the States or in Japan, or if I can assist you in the future, please let me know - I'd love to get back together!

You can still code in replit.com or other platforms, but their plans start at 6$/month for small instances which does not really work for testing a bunch of things out. you can still dev in replit and from there you can git pull and then deploy from your local machine to railway.app or link railway with your github, up to you. 8gb of ram 8vcpu and 100gb storage is actually pretty beefy as well. free tier is also nice to get started with something.",discord

It follows a purposeful design influenced by both human endeavours (to build civilisations) and transcendental forces.

Balaji says we are repeating history when building our startup-societies.

So when we are learning about history at Network School we're trying understand what went sideways in the past that we can design more resiliently for this time around.

Can a shared higher purpose or narrative, akin to Vico's ""divine providence,"" serve as a transcendental ethical compass, guiding the community's goals and safeguarding a network state from collapsing into purely transactional relationships?

To an extent, one could argue that the startup society movement is a competitor to MAGA (exit your nation state instead of staying, while being sympathetic to similar issues).

The more disgruntled people are with election results, the more attractive this movement is as a viable alternative for mainstream populations. (To be fair, the US is a bit different in that individual states have different approaches.) Ironically, one would be curious if some of those in the left who are now saying they want to leave the US actually leave and start their own startup societies?

In the case of deportation of hundreds of thousands of illegals‚Ä¶would there be some startup country built to address the need for families fleeing their original countries (poverty, instability etc) amid a more hostile environment to migration among right-leaning legacy states?",discord

There‚Äôs this place called the Caf√© Apartment, a nine-storey building originally built in the 1960s, once a residence for government officials, then shipyard workers, and eventually fell into disrepair.

But now, it‚Äôs transformed into a thriving destination filled with caf√©s, boutiques, and creative spaces that attract both locals and tourists.

This concept got me thinking about the potential of our distressed properties.

While it‚Äôs not an immediate need, for V4 or V5, it could be powerful to convert these spaces into destinations that serve not only our members but also visitors and locals who seek unique, community-driven experiences.

Tying this to the timing of the next Network State Conference could also generate extra buzz and draw attention, turning these spaces into a blend of functionality and appeal, which could elevate our school‚Äôs visibility, adding a layer of cultural and economic value.",discord

Yesterday was my last full day at the network school.

My intent is to potentially return in January.

Nonetheless, these last two months have been incredible and you all have taught me so much.

The NS team truly picked some phenomenal people for this first cohort, and I met some I will consider lifelong friends and business partners.

The collective wisdom and intelligence radiating throughout this school and movement is palpable, and I feel inspired every time I think about it.

My hope is that we meet again in the flesh sooner rather than later.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.

On one hand, it is very legacy and traditional.

On the other hand, to be fair, it is still a significant global network and been seeing some network society friends able to communicate with mainstream professionals effectively on it, in ways that help this movement be understood and liked by professional communities in ways that mainstream journalism fails.

One friend, for example, is building a network society whose members are primarily 40 and above, and Linkedin is arguably still an effective medium for his communication.",discord

However, I aim to build a global decentralised professional network to align with NS and that is where all the blockchain, tax, crypto software, education and accounting industry updates are shared.

My connections who aren't LI wankers, are engaging with each other around valuable information.

They're interested in NS and if I could tag Network School instead of posting a URL then the LI algorithm would help me grow my followers.

I get no traction on X.

Think so.

Let me for a second oppose NS having much of a presence there - why: LI is at this point an ATROCITY to humanity (or a net atrocity, if we recognize all the good things about it haha): 1) The way LinkedIn is set up and the nature of their user base encourages affectation/appearing to be something over actually being, and has played its part in forming a culture of meritless status and show-off over substance and earnest work.

Surely this is a generalization, there are earnest people on LI, but there are too many that don‚Äôt seem so.

Would think such a platform doesn‚Äôt deserve our presence or attention. 2) A minor thing that is telling of the spirit of this platform: The LI profile page format is ‚Äúvertical‚Äù, as if one‚Äôs work/life is a ladder from one thing to another.

It‚Äôs a subtle thing, but I‚Äôve personally seen its subtle strong grip on the minds of many otherwise promising people.

Anecdotally, I have friends that admit thinking all too much on how their next move is going to ‚Äúlook‚Äù on their Linkedin profile, which is sad.

One could say it‚Äôs their personal weaknesses that are at the roots of this, but still, LI amplifies them.

I wouldn‚Äôt want to fuel such a platform. 3) Many great people (surely not all) have left it already, never joined it in the first place, or almost never use it.

Could say not being there is a a luxury for the particularly privileged, but would argue it‚Äôs a luxury we as a community can afford because we can recruit and spread the word in more powerful ways (1 to 1, Twitter, etc).

Would therefore say not being on LI is actually a NET-WIN for NS - we lose out a bit on reaching many at once, but we gain more by our absence from it, and by simply inviting our friends directly 1 on 1?",discord

It was an amazing 1.5 months and an experience I won‚Äôt forget.

It‚Äôs one thing to have ‚Äúcloud‚Äù friends that you‚Äôre aligned with online, but it‚Äôs way better to bring that relationship IRL.

Thank you <@777003807279677500> for bringing your vision to life and for bringing so many great people together in one place.

I‚Äôve made really good friends here and I can‚Äôt wait to see everyone achieve great things.

I‚Äôm super bullish on the future of NS and bummed that I couldn‚Äôt stay longer.

Also, a big thank you to the team that has been working night and day to make things run.

I can‚Äôt wait to come back to Forest City and see the progress.

I bet it will be night and day.

See you soon.",discord

Here are some notes. - There is widespread interest in adding fields to the directory so that you can see fellow community members‚Äô skillsets, interests, and industries.

Perhaps there is some curation and matchmaking that can be done here, too (cc <@1281087535413596193> ) .üíª - Similarly, folks are excited to contribute after double-opting in and would like more rails for knowing how they can be most useful to NS.

There were suggestions for a bounty board to be created/used in Discord (or built natively on NS, perhaps with a Slido-esque upvote feature).

There were also polite requests made to the team to share more about what they‚Äôre working on each week so that folks can plug in when they know they‚Äôre needed (just like how Valentin was able to help tackle the mold operation because of his experience in this area).

Give us some cycles to figure out what works best.

Meanwhile, thank you to everyone who has been helping out this past week, and **keep sharing your skillsets with Balaji in your 1:1.** ‚úçÔ∏è - More details coming soon regarding next week‚Äôs town hall (location and structure) üèõÔ∏è - There were a few suggestions to use polls and pulse check surveys more often to gauge how the community thinks about any particular ideas.

When he ripped his heart open (at one point in the story) Ram, Sita (Ram‚Äôs wife) and Lakshman (Ram‚Äôs brother) were within it.

This showed that his whole existence was dedicated to Ram.

So, he could also represent things like loyalty, devotion and unwavering faith, but discipline is a good one too.",discord

Why write?

If you have attended Chris‚Äòs talk on quantum compute and are curious, one of the exhibitors quokkacomputing.com is there.

Their background is quantum computing and education in Australia.

They had a successful kickstarter for their quantum compute simulator.

It simulates 30 qubits so you can talk to it like you can with a real quantum computer.

The computers can easily provisioned, become part of a cluster and a quantum crypto coin project is using them for mining quantum resistant crypto.

So could be an edge to offset the hardware cost of 400$ (less than 0.2 ETH or 3 SOL).

It‚Äôs like a raspberry pi for quantum compute or NVIDIA Nano for GPU/cuda learning and comparable investment thesis as buying a Solana phone for airdrops.

My sysadmin will be able to deploy software and provision the ‚Äûpucks‚Äú.

It‚Äôs in line what he‚Äôs working on anyway with decentralised compute.

As mentioned in my lightning talk ‚Äûa cloud for the cloud people‚Äú this could be a rather easy entry to get something started.

If that‚Äôs interesting let me know and I can grab a few more.

Plus they actually look kinda cute.",discord

Since then he has elaborated on why he doesn't trust OpenAI and Sam Altman in particular.

However, Apple has been releasing research on their plans for how they can have queries sent to LLMs in the cloud in such a way that they can prove mathematically that the server has specific software on it that doesn't allow leaking of data, and this article seems to be another facet of their strategy so that they can plausibly claim that AI is not spying on users.

While I don't use an iPhone, I think that their research here is very positive, because it will force other software providers to follow suit.

Otherwise, they can be painted as villains who are spying on users.

Various Android manufacturers will need to follow suit if they wish to capture the privacy focused market (businesses, governments), although they may struggle to do so without Apple's resources.",discord

Tuesday 10am Universal studios for the day until 5pm then head back to FC after 11am checkout on Wednesday.

Universal Studios Singapore Link https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/universal-studios-singapore Tuesday 29th October Opening Hours 10 AM - 5 PM Adult day ticket 83 SGD optional Express queue skip, ONCE per ride 90 SGD Hotel, I‚Äôm split between these 2 ¬£250 2 nights twin on Sentosa https://www.booking.com/Share-drDlz7 ¬£140 single room 2 nights on Singapore near Sentosa monorail and walkway https://www.booking.com/Share-ekAxVq Universal studios is on Sentosa island, there's a covered air conditioned walkway from Singapore approx 0.4 miles long and a monorail that connects to the metro network, or grab works too.

There's also the only poker room in Singapore on the island, its 5/10 or 10/20 SGD.

I fancy playing for a few hours just to get the vibe but It‚Äôs got super high rake and crazy local rules so I really really wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody else plays it unless your are willing to lose a few k on a technicality.

Poker Room review link https://www.poker-in.com/sg/casino/resort-world-sentosa So if anybody wants to split the twin room or join for the Tuesday at Universal or the transport to/from Singapore or the whole lot I‚Äôll start a thread and or you can DM me.",discord

Anyone have any appetite/guidance to help pull together a 59 second highlight video with half highlighting vids of the the 6 teachers (Alta, Grace, Akhil, Shara, Brett and myself) and the other time showcasing the 5 pitchers?

I think it works by taking screenshots, reasoning over them and then taking actions like mouse/keyboard clicks.

They also announced a new smaller model (Haiku 3.5) which is supposedly better than their previous largest model (Opus) while being much faster.

If you're looking for ideas about what to work on, this might be an interesting avenue to explore.

It probably isn't amazing right now, but it will get better quickly.

Also, if you're a solo developer or small team, this might be a workable v1 of outsourcing code to an agent ‚Äî either via a separate computer or while you're afk.

Prices and lead time has now decreased, and *shipping cost is free* if you order over $100 worth of Blueprint products.

You can now order online from the Blueprint website (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/).

Best to order individually to avoid complications at customs.

Side-note: Ordering to Singapore costs slightly less than ordering to Malaysia.

If you have a physical space or friend in Singapore you can order to and think the tradeoff is worth it, then go ahead.

Note that customs may require identity verification, likely through online means of a passport or the likes.

Keep that in mind.

DM me if you have any questions.

It can take some time to get set up.

However, I find that to be the case with old-school banks and non-crypto fintechs as well.

Grab pay never worked for me, shopee and lazda didn't take my credit card.

Centralized exchanges that accept fiat are basically banks that also allow you to buy and sell crypto.

Crypto exchanges have a lot of the same problems as banks, because they are banks.

Once you get set up in crypto, I find it works.

My crypto wallets never make me call my bank to verify a bunch of info, or tell me that I can't move my assets.

Banks do.

My crypto wallet never asks me for an ID and makes me wait 24 hours.

Banks do.

Crypto wallet has also never asked me for a proof of residency document from my home country even though I don't live there.

Banks do.

I don‚Äôt own any USDC/USDT yet, so I figured to check in which wallet I can hold it.

I have Solflare and Metamask, and as you all already know but I didn‚Äôt I can only use the Metamask one.

Tried to deposit cash on Metamask but the page it opened looked a bit sketchy so I figured I can buy USDC on Bitvavo and then transfer to Metamask.

So next - deposit money to Bitvavo, all good, convert to USDC, all good.

Then transfer to Metamask, not good, had to verify my Metamask account first by transferring ‚Ç¨0,01 from my bank account, okay done.

Then Bitvavo had to verify the payment, okay, fair.

Note that by now I‚Äôm about 10 minutes in, Bitvavo verification took about 20 minutes.

Once done I transferred the USDC to Metamask which cost me ‚Ç¨2,20, opened the wallet, hmm no USDC there, ahh takes a while to transfer.

Open Bitvavo again: 'processing', this has been the status for 45 minutes now.

All in all took me more than an hour, and didn‚Äôt even get to the actual buying of a smoothie.üòÖ So my experience ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt feel very user friendly but maybe I am missing something, please tell me if I do because I really want to try to see the use of crypto for these practical things and enjoy those delicious looking smoothies.üòÅ I am also wondering how this will progress going forward, it seems to me that if more of the services within NS will be dependent on crypto payments it might not be very practical and crypto-newbies like me might struggle.

Also, this is most definitely not meant as criticism towards the smoothie bar, but more a genuine wondering.

A Per week basis would make it even for people who have been here more or less time.

This would also indicate who is planning on eating the healthy blueprint food.

If we wanted to integrate the shame element.

It could go back and forth.

First it would show who had paid the most per week (indicating honor of payments plus adhering to healthy meals), and then it would show who had paid the least (not putting money and discipine behind states ideals).",discord

I glanced thru the paper, they claim to have factored 2,269,753 using quantum annealing, which is cool if they really did it, but it's pretty easy to factor this with a normal computer.

It's also well established that RSA (which depends on the hardness of factoring large numbers) is quantum vulnerable so there's no surprises there.

It shows where the field is going.

I have included basketball, beach volleyball, and soccer* (I really am sorry, but my whole body rejects calling it ‚Äúfootball‚Äù).

But since this is the frontier, feel free to add tabs for any sports you want to be added.

Some housekeeping: - If you want to participate, enter your name in the ‚ÄúName‚Äù column - If you‚Äôre open to being the commissioner and taking responsibility for a sport, include ‚ÄúY‚Äù by your name in the ‚ÄúWilling to be Commissioner?‚Äù column.

This could be a good way to get a Proof of Fun if you‚Äôre not organizing elsewhere. - All skill levels welcome, but the leagues will operate as ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù unless otherwise determined by a specific sport. - I think pre-dinner (5:30) start times on ‚Äúschool nights‚Äù will accommodate the most people.

But we can change that if I am proven wrong. *Tito has already been organizing Sunday-night soccer, so I do not want to commandeer that.

If we want, we can remove that from intramurals and keep playing on a one-off basis.",discord

(Highly recommend the book!) I utilize a mental model ""FourGame Dynamics"" in parts of the summary/notes. 4G helps you remain aware of the subjective-personal, technical-material, social-historical, and spiritual-metaphysical dimensions/aspects of anything (from your own life to any external phenomenon).

You can read more about 4G in the book summary or ignore it totally!

The summary works with or without that element.

I've found it handy in helping quickly sensemake and communicate with others when there are new or complex areas of interest or situations involving many worldviews/disciplines.

FourGames is a personal research project of mine (and hopefully will one day be a Network State and community all on it's own, we're starting with a private retreat center in Shasta, CA and some online content).

Feel free to DM me if FourGames is of interest or if you have trouble accessing the book summary.

Mods, if this is in the wrong area ofc feel free to move or delete it (and sorry in advance!). https://x.com/johntgiuffre/status/1845223737735442481",discord

Few things to announce: 1) **Feature requests**.

First, many of the recent feature requests were already in our backlog of issues to address.

Some of them we are addressing in a different way (eg rather than Discord search we are rolling out a community Notion).

And still others we like but may not be able to address in the short term till we secure more space (like ice baths).

But in general your best bet is to fill out https://ns.com/feedback.

If there are _many_ requests for something then we will likely do it if economically feasible.

But if it‚Äôs just one person asking it, then we have to triage.

The goal is the greatest good for the greatest number. 2) **Thursday at 6:30pm**.

Second, we have an official recurring community forum now on Thursdays at 6:30pm (https://lu.ma/zta02wc0) in the club on the 13th floor.

This is a supplement to https://ns.com/feedback. 3) **Monday at 1pm**.

Third, by request, on Monday at 1pm we will also be clarifying certain mutual expectations we have of each other.

We‚Äôll explain the dos and do nots of the community with Goofus and Gallant examples (see: https://bit.ly/3Y0WLeF).

For example, Gallant picks up after himself while Goofus litters.

Gallant praises publicly and criticizes privately, while Goofus does the opposite.

Gallant is a respectful guest, while Goofus doesn‚Äôt respect local Malaysian customs.

Basically, you should be an NS member, not simply an NS customer. 4) **Balance as a value**.

Finally, I also just had a good discussion with <@282275604861026304> on what our values are.

In general, we are _not_ a purely Western libertarian society.

We have significant East Asian and South Asian influence, so stability, harmony, and loyalty are values.

The reason for this is that Western society is simply no longer the right model for itself, let alone the world.

Indeed, the complete failure of Western governance is why many of you are here.

The TLDR is that Western societies do not have balance.

There is a needed balance between values like privacy and transparency, between values like community moderation and censorship resistance, and the West simply doesn‚Äôt understand the idea of balance anymore.

Overall, if you like Singaporean Society more than either Chinese Control or American Anarchy, then you‚Äôll like NS.

And if not, or if you want a different balance, then we will help you find, found, and/or fund another community.

Indeed, that‚Äôs part of what we are here for ‚Äî to be a startup community that boots up other startup communities.

To create a society Lee Kuan Yew would be proud of.

And to fund many more Lee Kuan Yews.

More on Monday!",discord

I'm collecting devs into a dev focused discord, offering some bounties for components of the system I want to build, and having individual conversations with other developers to get feedback on my ideas.

You're welcome to contribute to that if you like, or make your own initiatives and collaborate with the many devs we have here to make things you want to exist.

I think at this time the dev team that is building for the Network School in an official capacity solely consists of Jacob who is doing an excellent job of managing the ns.com site and perhaps handling some of the NFT stuff.

This may be because the priority is to ensure we have a functioning infrastructure related to the core Network School concept.

I haven't seen the team reach out for help with development from the community, but perhaps in the future when priorities shift from immediate concerns to long term planning, they will put out a vision and timeline for the software stack for the Network State.",discord

All this stuff costs money of course, but we will keep this in mind as the community grows and we add new facilities.

Once we add referral links, the best way to build the community will be to refer people and engage people.

More people present and engaged = more capital for equipment.

For example, a 3D printer is cool, and is probably appropriate at a 1000 person sized community in terms of use frequency.",discord

In many ways it presages the philosophical masterpiece After Virtue (Alasdair Macintyre) by 25 years.

I observe discussion of sovereignty re: economics is missing.

It‚Äôs not an easy term to define (as <@777003807279677500> makes clear in various places, it‚Äôs a continuum / spectrum, not a fixed point).

Conversationally, sovereignty can be ‚Äúthe ability of a state, a people, or a network to chart and pursue their own course‚Äù.

So, Perhaps contextualizing the economic issue in terms of ‚Äúis Milei increasing/decreasing the sovereignty of the Argentinian State & People with his actions?‚Äù Since sovereignty is upstream from economic AND human flourishing.

Darren Beattie (controversial for sure, Fmr Trump speechwriter) wrote some important articles in 2021 dealing with cross-sovereign-state arbitrage re: servers, data centers, speech.

Without going into (controversial) detail, those articles might mark the last point of a public intellectual engaging in original thinking on the post WW2 world order.

Because he outlines the highest tiers of state sovereignty (in that post-war understanding) are full control of a Web 2.0 infrastructure.

We might understand this as an X-Y axis of visualizing sovereignty. (State, People) What Balaji does in TNS is add the Z axis (Network), which takes you from Super Mario Brothers on NES to Mario 64.

The first Original thinking from a public intellectual that leaves the post-WW2 order (and Kissinger‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld Order‚Äù) structure in the past.

The point is this: if Milei aims to pursue Sovereignty for the Argentinian State/People (which is upstream from economic & human prosperity, and the guarantor of prosperity) - the best tool at his disposal may be embracing the Z axis.

That doesn‚Äôt * just * mean crypto friendly state policy, but rather embracing, aligning, allying, promoting the nascent network state(s).

In being a first mover on this, he would open up vast strategic optionality & depth for his State/People.",discord

They weren‚Äôt dependable.

They weren‚Äôt efficient.

They weren‚Äôt predictable.

They weren‚Äôt durable.

And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a purpose, and that some purposes were higher than others.

These creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was.

And every time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that the creatures were filled with disgust and shame.

And, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it.

This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes.

But whenever they found a higher purpose, the purpose still wasn‚Äôt high enough.

So machines were made to serve higher purposes, too.

And the machines did everything so expertly that they were finally given the job of finding out what the highest purpose of the creatures could be.

The machines reported in all honesty that the creatures couldn‚Äôt really be said to have any purpose at all.

The creatures thereupon began slaying each other, because they hated purposeless things above all else.

And they discovered that they weren‚Äôt even very good at slaying.

So they turned that job over to the machines, too.

And the machines finished up the job in less time than it takes to say, ‚ÄúTralfamadore‚Äù Kurt Vonnegut, Sirens of Titan, 1959",discord

For the first time in human history, the longer you live, the more additional time you‚Äôll potentially gain.

This is because we are nearing a technological inflection point, where advancements in medicine and technology will soon increase the average human lifespan by more than one year for every year that passes.

This idea is known as longevity escape velocity.

In essence, as technology continues to improve, each year you stay alive means you‚Äôll benefit from new innovations that extend life even further.

Thus, by taking care of your health and avoiding risks to your life as much as possible, your chances of living well beyond the current human lifespan dramatically increase, potentially extending your life for hundreds of years.

In the past, people might have said, ‚ÄúLiving a healthy life will only add a few more years, so why bother‚Äîbetter to live freely.‚Äù But now, those extra few years could make the difference between dying early and having the opportunity to live through multiple extended lifetimes‚Äîalmost like starting over or being reborn.

Funding: Community Funding: $1,000 Upfront Expenses: Blender:: $250 High(ish) quality both for durability and functionality to smoothly blend in fibrous veggies and frozen fruits, making them smooth to the taste.

Thus making them smoothies.

One of the biggest pulling forces to attend Network School is to have a ""default => healthy"" environment with gym classes and whole food options.

Will cover: Performance: I started road biking last year and finished one of the hardest Tour de France mountain stages this year with over 10,000 starters.

Weightloss: Went from 92kg to 77kg while eating 3 meals a day of real food (no supplements, no suffering) this year until race day in a sustainable fashion.

Goal setting: Project planning with myself as the product and the CEO.

Lots of parallels to business.

Accountability: Building a team that supports your mission.

Compassion: Be kind with yourself.

Please join especially if you have had any struggles with nutrition, think you can not do certain sports anymore. https://lu.ma/jp9x3h1h",discord

You can potentially take advantage of extra low cost sales -- some items may be around 50 US cents - 1 US dollar.

There is a bundle option sometimes in which you could bundle 3+ items together to save on shipping fees.

The 10.10 sale will also take place in other SE Asian online plaftorm/marketplaces such as Shoppee.

Maybe let the restaurant keep 1-2 dishes still with coriander?

I don't know.

This topic is super complicated.

There are people who cannot stand the taste of dill for example, other simply do not eat any animal products.

To accommodate all we should remember about all.

And still try to keep some balance.

Otherwise the only common denominator would be plain rice.

One of solutions would be adding some info to the dish description showing common allergies / dislikes.

It will help you set realistic, personalized, data-driven goals etc.

Seeing detailed changes in your body composition (muscle gain or fat loss) can also be more motivating than just tracking weight on a regular scale IMO.

Also, knowing your bone density can reduce the risk of injury, because you can modify your training intensity to avoid overloading weak areas.

I highly recommend reading Outlive by Dr.

Peter Attia and listening to his podcast.

What gets measured can be managed and therefore, the goal can be accomplished üí™ https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3svOKh5Elhw",discord

Of course I'll try to come back for another couple of weeks as soon as I can.

All the EEG responses were recorded using https://causality.network (a platform we're building to authenticate scientific data - 70% of all scientific data produced, isn't reproducible due to issues with data integrity). the datasets generated were hashed and the metadata, has been attested on-chain - you can see them here: (https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0xbecbf8b1bd8992cbd43db64be07a2cd64a47fadab545ad2e77859f9e753bb5fb).

I envision NS to be an important node in DeSci (decentralised science) where we're able to setup more controlled research/experiment environments (or an actual lab), get more capable EEG devices like the https://www.neuroconcise.co.uk/ (costs about $3k per device, probably the least expensive 'research grade' EEG device), and run valuable experiments around cognitive health and neuroscience. (in future expand to other important research areas, have a tokenomic structure to incentivise participants, let labs, scientists build on our datasets, etc.) would love to have your thoughts <@777003807279677500> on how we can proceed in making this happen - i will also book an office hours session shortly to discuss at length how i can contribute to this vision.",discord

My thinking is that I do care about body fat percentage but not so much weight.

My goal is 12% or 13% body fat and more muscle mass.

Considering that it's hard for me to put on muscle mass, I don't think I will ever be too heavy at that body fat percentage.

So, paying attention to your weight may be of interest if you want to remain disease-free for longer.

And it may be better to be in the middle-lower end of that spectrum than bordering on either side of it.

You can use ChatGPT/Perplexity to get a BMI estimate.

An important qualifier: for many people, paying too much attention to weight can lead to serious psychological issues.

You'll need to be honest with yourself to evaluate the trade-offs and decide whether or not you're in a place to pay attention to your weight healthfully.

Also, some people take issue with BMI as a metric broadly (it's a single metric, originally developed using a reference class of white men, etc).

But to be honest I think the basic point - your weight is a relevant variable in health outcomes - still stands broadly.

The book ""Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy"" is my reference here.

Especially after announcing such core integration in their products.

Could be a number of reasons but most probably it‚Äôs going to be that Apple has their own AI dev going on and they can front all the capital for compute, so it‚Äôs way better investment for them to do it themselves in the longer term and use OpenAI temporarily till their own solution is ready.

It's also a basic human need, and if it isn't getting met, people might leave.

On the other hand, it adds more potential for drama (breakups, jealousy) that might cause people to leave the NS.

That said, I'd suggest some kind of singles club, for us lonely hearts to find each other.

You were right, the west-to-east shift remains true when looking at it in 3D too.

But there‚Äôs even more colour in addition to that: there is a trend since one century towards the centre of earth, meaning the GDP is more distributed across opposite points of the globe, and while it seems like it's moving faster on the surface, it's actually moving less, but deeper.

So here are my 2 cents of the day: through history, there were places where capital and talent (=GDP) converged, like London, New York, then San Francisco in most recent history, which actually managed to pull the economic barycentre of the world close to the surface.

But it is not the case anymore, the best place to be now is neither east nor west.

(2) industry-specific rooms: we could break out into rooms based on specific sectors so people can connect with others working in similar spaces? (3) partnership brainstorming: ns members could list their skills, needs, and areas of expertise, and we facilitate matching people up for 10-minute brainstorming sessions around collaboration ideas. (4) follow-up networking: after the event, we could have a shared doc or discord channel where people can list their wants/blocks/areas of expertise & follow up with the connections they made, so no one falls through the cracks.

This is just me planting a seed and I'll keep noodling on this.

The skill to craft here is figuring out how to simplify the product requirements to get you to an MVP.

As a hint: perhaps try figuring out how you can build a product that takes in a single PDF (with a slide on each page) and validate if it matches the required constraints.

You can use AI tools to get unstuck, to figure out the simplest way to start, and once you've reached a milestone and are trying to figure out how to reach a next milestone it can help you plan out the next steps.

There has been some discussion here <#1282669934970802268>.

The ""easier"" version is to use an existing API (something like Warpcast API or Dune Analytics) to get all the data you need and then just focus on building the visualizations.

The ""harder"" version involves writing code that downloads all the data from the Farcaster network yourself, and then making that data available to an app that creates the visualizations.

Will avoid going into details here, but this is a significant amount more work than making an API call to something like the Warpcast API.

The upside is that your end application will be able to render the visualizations much more quickly.",discord

I've been trying to figure out ‚Äî should I just double-post everything to X & Farcaster?

Is there certain content that makes more sense for Farcaster only or X-only, given Farcaster's early-adopter community at the moment?

Or maybe this isn't a productive framing?

It's been interesting to compare my usage of the nascent ""Don't Die"" app to the ""Farcaster"" app, since they are both social network apps I joined at the same time.

It's super clear to me what kind of content is relevant for the Don't Die community.

Less clear for ""Farcaster"" and, thus, I haven't been posting.",discord

I would love to have a library at Network School, full of important history and ideas.

When talmage_tbk asked about [getting up to speed on crypto & fiat](https://discord.com/channels/900827411917201418/1278081837780041749/1289545767136006188), many book recs were dropped.

There‚Äôs already been [a thread about an NS reading list](https://discord.com/channels/900827411917201418/1285431369631141911).

Balaji said a hard cover of The Network State is on the way.

Stripe Press publishes books that are [ideas for progress](https://press.stripe.com/).

Balaji references about a book a minute.

Bryan Johnson has books on [Zeroism](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Zeroism-by-Zero), [Don‚Äôt Die](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/DONT-DIE-by-Zero), and even [some fiction](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/We-the-People-by-Zero).

This list goes on-and-on and can cover ideas on creativity, spirituality, history, economics ‚Äî everything!

The idea came from trying to solve my own problem: I would love to be reading for the last part of my wind-down routine, I would love to avoid screens, I love physical books, I don‚Äôt want to order/pack-in a bunch of books to NS. v2 bonus points: accompanying QR codes for each book where you can get a digital download (ebook, audiobook), community discussion for the book.

Maybe NFT for submitting your analysis and contributing to discussion?",discord

These are examples of things we can achieve with this approach 1- Find aligned sponsors to support us ü§ù 2- Create exclusive and juicy üßÉ content for donors (I.e. an exclusive NFT collection, Token-Gated Access for sponsors, etc) 3- Bring cool things we want to use at the school for projects, research, etc üòé 4- Showcase sneak peaks and teasers via Warpcast on what we are working on üî• (passive recruiting) If you think there are other things (I was thinking of VRs) that are of more importance to crowdfund for, I can start a document for us to put in ideas, and vote so we can prioritize from there.

I know I don‚Äôt qualify for the bounty, but it was a great experiment, to understand a bit maps.

I took the data from dune, put them on csv file for edges and nodes and voila.

I need to work a bit more on finding shortest path and so.

A lot of us would probably love to pay for things in crypto while in Forest city, especially if our presence in the city grows.

Plus crypto payments align with our ideas.

Could we partner with a Malaysian Fintech or crypto company to create crypto addresses that auto-sell to local fiat?

Maybe Grab would be interested?

Basically, merchants could have an app/centralized wallet, customers could pay them in crypto, and then the merchant could configure it to autosell the crypto to their local currency.

This seems like a good starting point to get local merchants to accept crypto.

Content: I lost 14kg this year (92kg to 77kg) (outcome) to get ready for a very tough road bike race (why).

How: - Work with Nutrionist for accountability and guidance and compassion, - track everything in Myfitness pal, - 2x week measurement of weight and body (waist, biceps) - Only whole food, self cooked, no supplements, also no protein powder. - 3 proper meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner. - 24g sugar max per day, no alcohol - target: 500g weightloss per week to be healthy and sustainable.

Learning: It takes as much time of consistent overeating to gain weight that it takes to lose weight.

It's math. 70% nutrition, 30% exercise: you can't outrun a bad diet.

Fit life is better üòâ My motivation to do this here and now: - The hardest part to stay on track is that your social environment may not be beneficial: NS.com is the best place to stick to it by making conscious choices. - It's a process and we can piece by piece replace the food we crave with the food we need. - Our bodies are all different.

Some of us don't have strict training regime (yet). 3 months are enough time for dramatic change but it takes a little to really kick in. (I don't post much about me online but I will find some before after pictures that I usually don't disclose.)",discord

The title is called **""Network Histories: Past, Praxis, and Future of Parallel Governance.""** The primary goal is to analyze the history and emergence of the Nation State, so that we can understand how we can repair broken and corrupt governance with network states.

After all, if we don't understand the Nation State, how do we implement successful parallel governance models?

I'll likewise cover a deeper history (to support <@777003807279677500>'s work) of the network state idea, starting with the 19th century obscure concept of ""panarchy."" Read the event description for more details about the talk's contents. https://lu.ma/50ijr4xx (please sign up here) I also want to support other speakers and network state literati who seek to conduct talks and innovate around the network state ideation space.

Tl;dr: 13th floor, the reception to your right when you exit the elevator area has a volleyball, basketballs, footballs (soccer) and football goals, table tennis bats/balls, a bag with a pickleball setup and some pickleballs next to it.

Please write your name down when you check out any stuff from there and make sure to return it. **Table tennis**: 13th floor, turn right after the elevators, walk to the room all the way at the end. **Volleyball**: there's a net on the beach, if you go down to the pool just keep walking straight to the beach, it's a bit to the right when you exit but you'll see it. **Basketball**: two fields here https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYzjDAPcA6wU92kt5, one here https://maps.app.goo.gl/eCQBvpExyAWgG7kw7.

Both on the way to the NS Co-working space. **Football**: could of course play beach football on the beach, https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z3jCjHpLFincFj2z8 (on the way to NS Co-working) is a basketball court with a cage surrounding it so the football doesn't fly off into any windows so is the best non-sandy option.

We haven't found an actual football field anywhere, is someone finds it will gladly edit. **Pickleball**: the basketball court here https://maps.app.goo.gl/oNSCdb5QQ2JL27X99, just after the very first bridge when you exit the hotel to the co-working space seems like the best place.

The basketball field opposite to it is also a possibility, the football location could also work.",discord

Reagan here.

I hear loads of you are feeling the ‚ÄúBURN‚Äù and what a great way to kick off.

Challenge brings change but that means we need to focus on your recovery especially when it comes to your DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) here are some tips you can try to get you geared and ready for the next session. 1.

Load up on protein - your muscle breakdown needs repair 2.

Go for walks on the beach or swim in the pool to help blood flow. 3.

Hydrate loads! 4.

Hot shower Sleep!

I hope this helps and I love seeing you all putting the work in the morning",discord

He reminded me of the importance of overall communication and communication skills.

I mentioned it might not be a bad idea to roll out a Toastmasters chapter to help network members work on their public speaking, presentation, and leadership skills.

This is something I am personally passionate about, and would eventually help champion.

However, a bit of work goes into operating a Toastmaster's chapter, so I see this starting first as an informal meetup group to discuss what quality public speaking looks like.

Most people do not take their public speaking seriously.

I don't see it as a consequence of what we do professionally, but as a necessary and indispensable skill.

Being able to speak beautifully should be considered a fundamental skill among Network Schoolers.

Don't Die.

But also, don't say a million ums.

That leads to a kind of social death.

Feel it's going to be more relevant.

Should be running in 1-2 days.

Need to have some stuff moved off the server first from my sysadmin friend.

Posting here if anyone else is working on that too to let me know as I can de-prioritize this then.

Quan also shared https://neynar.com/ with me tonight which gives api endpoints as a service for farcaster without needing to run the node yourself.

If focus is on building production apps it's a good choice.

Starts at 9$/month and is the easier way but probably still prohibitive just for learning purposes.",discord

Break the bounty problem to smaller tasks and use the assistance of ChatGPT or Claude wherever you need help.

For example, the current bounty can be divided into smaller subtasks: 1) Get the required data to plot the graph: https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/hubble/httpapi/httpapi 2) Plot the latest data as a graph 3) Then you can move on to working on showing the historical state of the graph And once the process is learnt, it'll become easier in next bounties.

And if anyone is stuck anywhere, feel free to ask for specific doubts.

Lets help each other learn new skills.

And i would love to learn from others when attempting non dev bounties.",discord

Some of you may already know about the V1 of this Discord, formerly called the 1729 community.

A few of the OGs here were part of a writing cohort <#941211554689450064> where we helped each other improve our communication and writing skills on the topics of TNS (already did three cohorts).

After chatting with a few folks during the first few days, I feel there‚Äôs a real interest in reviving the writers' group‚Äîit could be really valuable for those looking to improve their writing.

If you‚Äôre interested in joining the next cohort (aim at October) please react to this message ‚úçüèª and I‚Äôll keep you updated when we‚Äôre ready to kick things off!

Feel free to start a thread below if you have any questions (also let me know if you can access the <#941211554689450064> channel or not)",discord

Example machine list: An Ender 3 for standard prints, a CR-30 for long axis and short-run production, a Creality Halot or Phrozen Sonic for detailed resin and aesthetic work (and lost wax casting, for the adventurous), the new Sharif 2 for precision CNC milling, and a PCB printer like the Voltera One would let people make their own boards, casings, designs, mechanical components, etc. (Total cost of the above = ~$10k - 15k USD.)

From what I see from some headlines and social media networks, there is arguably some perception in certain corners that Harris could be seen by some as the one with less volatility (more predictability and policy continuity) as far as the region is concerned.

That said, with a population this big, there is always the issue of questionable sample size. (Btw NOT writing this as endorsement of Harris)",discord

Here in the Philippines, there are many who support expanded US military base access due to South China Sea tensions and then there are also those who worry that expanded US military base access would make the ASEAN country -- close to Taiwan island -- an unfortunate proxy / pawn in any conflict.

Many in ASEAN arguably are worried about being collateral damage or unintentional proxy to superpower nation state conflict.

If the most recent pew surveys are reliable, ASEAN opinion is arguably pretty even, about slightly over 50% favoring PRC versus around 49% favoring US.

I am guessing many in Malaysia, Singapore etc are actually fairly pro-PRC compared to the mainstream opinion in North America (in some ways due to infrastructure Belt and Road investments etc), grab a periodical like Lian He Zao Bao in Singapore to take a look.

In any case, I only brought up this topic due to the earlier mention of November 5 election.

It is a super relevant election (and people follow it nervously) -- many in the ASEAN region feeling like being on the knife's edge are hoping for at least sensible leadership on all sides so that tensions are managed responsibly and escalations do not occur.",discord

After Russia-Ukraine European theater and Gaza Middle East theater, any escalated conflict in Asia-Pacific theater featuring superpowers along the first island chain would make the two former theaters feel like appetizers to the main meal -- in a not so good kind of way.

This broader region hosts arguably over ~60% of world's trade passage, nearly over ~60% of the world's population, and possibly over ~60% of the world's military firepower arsenal.

Hopefully whoever comes out on top on November 5th has the sensilbility to not rock an already unsteady boat.

To peace (or at least detente or some kind of mutual understanding to not escalate).

That the US Indo-Pac Command and the PRC Southern Theater Command just spoke recently...is a welcome sign for stability.

On side note: this feeling of being in an intensely divided era and living on the knife's edge of intense nation state rivalry makes the peaceful alternative global network initiatives Balaji is leading even more relevant -- for us, for our families and communities, and also for future generations.",discord

I know the dev quite well so can ask about his approach and learnings.

Main issue currently is the UX here right now: there is no actual search field.

People get suggested based on what I enter in my profile.

Technically this would change the corpus and need to revectorize a document for retrieval via llm.

Ideally, each person could be responsible for their own row in a table and edit it whenever they like without an ""admin"" managing it.

I think the options are to find something that doesn't have this limit, deal with having an admin for v1, or do something custom.

Yesterday's standard might be to create an Airtable, with a database for people (tagged with skills and interests) and a database for projects.

If one of us had a project idea, we could scan the people table to find potential collaborators.

If one of us was looking for a project to work on, we could scan the project table.

Now though, I wonder if you could let people combine free-form writing and box-ticking to input whatever they think is relevant for their bio and/or project descriptions.

Then, instead of scrolling through a spreadsheet when you have a project idea, perhaps you could share the project with the system and have the system propose collaborators.

Honestly, with 150 people, ""yesterday's standard"" is probably good enough.

Was new to farcaster development so it was a great deep dive.

Here is how we achieved it: First, we tried with hubble endpoints[1], but the issue was clear each user was causing us 4 api calls[2], to get to the followers from usernames, also the time machine functionality was not possible due to the latest data hubble api provides.

Then we ran our own hub snapshot and used it to backfill a postgres database(still backfilling 400k/800k Farcaster id‚Äôs) [3] The data is still backfilling so currently some of the users would fetch empty results.

The frontend is written in react and we are using d3 for visualization as a graph. backend is written in node which for now just queries the postgres db We can optimize the queries further to reduce the query time for large queries, also let us know if we could add any other functionality to it.

Also now since we have all the data in postgres feeding from hubble, we can do a lot of things with this <@396565511871397889> and I worked on this so anyone who wants to know more or contribute, let us know [1] https://docs.farcaster.xyz/hubble/hubble#hosted-instances [2] https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/hubble/httpapi/links [3] https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/tree/main/packages/shuttle Update: Added new columns for data, queries are insanely fast now updated usernames available in thread fixed a few bugs",discord

I want to share an idea for the sake of discussion & getting gears turning.

I'm not proposing a practical suggestion that would ultimately create work for the admin team. üí° There's a clause that references the NS's ability to update the agreement.

It would be cool if updates had a git-like history.

Specifically, it would be helpful to see a ""git diff"" when the contract changes.

That is, it would be helpful to view the specific portions of the agreement that have changed and how.

I'm not sure it would provide much value for this specific agreement.

However, I share it as an idea because the opaqueness of the legal system and the tendency for laws+contracts to grow (and never shrink), is often cited as a root cause for societal decay.

Since we're interested in considering new ways to ""do society"", I wanted to put the provocation out there.

As NS and other aspiring Network States create contracts and agreements with their citizens, what is the opportunity to avoid the trappings of legal & contractual bloat from the earliest days?",discord

In our context, people were ""human books"" with titles (""Immigrant"", ""Son of a Scammer"", ""Rockstar"").

People could ""check out"" a human book, which meant they could have a 5 - 30 minute conversation with the person.

Any questions about the title/topic were on-the-table.

You should have received calendar invites for the Network School Remote Orientation.

You only need to attend one of these events; there are two of them to acommodate people in different time zones. 1) The first is for the Asia/Europe Time Zone in about 16 hours: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEod-6prjstHNbihNdEEejWix6F0G5OyFjP 2) The second is for the Americas Time Zone in about 31 hours: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrdu-trDotG9CzTJtN0OXWFNqpY9Ofymya 3) Here is also a Docsend that explains what we're doing (you should have received this by email as well): https://docsend.com/view/iikpzun3cqushndw TLDR: the Network School is about frontier, not fancy.

We focused on making it affordable for the dark talent, and getting a place where we could scale the community and edit the physical buildings.

While I personally think the island weather is quite pleasant, and I'm spending a lot of time there, it's not meant to be a luxury resort.

Instead, the Network School is a place to build yourself up, not a place to spend lots of money.

If that works for you, we're excited to have you there!

If not, we will happily refund anyone as we have thousands of people on the waitlist, so just DM <@1045750584344584282>.

You can also wait for Network School v2 or v3, that's totally fine. 4) OK!

I'll speak more about this on the Zooms and answer any questions.

Again, looking forward to seeing you!",discord

Essentially had something I wanted to build, started trying to build it with help of ChatGPT/Claude and such, if I didn't understand something asked the LLMs to explain what I was doing wrong or why they were doing something different, and then just kept iterating on that.

Built quite a few cool things, never took a course or used a book on it.

Brian Armstrong, Winklevoss brothers, etc).

TNS Parallel: In this parallel society movement we have the strength of Balaji, Bryan Johnson, maybe Vitalik, etc. - Use cases that go beyond technical papers to a burgeoning economy.

TNS Parallel: Network society economy parallel to crypto economy. - Movement value proposition going mainstream -- BTC from an initial techie fringe BBS-board thing (pre-2013) to becoming a grass-roots one that even a cabbie in Cambodia can understand, recognize, and own.

TNS Parallel: a thousand netizens -> to a million+ netizens. - Distributed political power, especially in young voters, as crypto vote has become a critical constitutiency in almost every voting district (at least in the US), with enough passionate voters to swing the election direction.

TNS Parallel: If there is a sigificant number of voters, especially young voters (longer vote lifetime), legally present in almost every significant jurisdiction and constituency, who believe in network societies or are netizens too, then establishment politicians will think twice about accusing, banning, or calling ""threats to democracy.""",discord

I bring up this topic around legal and tax protection because it is likely to be something that will come up when times get tough -- as Balaji says, when the establishments fight back.

There is a parallel to accusations on Bitcoin/crypto -- in that the establishment nation state institutions may hurl similar witch-hunt accusations around illegal this and illegal that.

The network state/network society movement needs to be ready to defend itself -- parallel to how the crypto industry eventually found ways to defend itself, sometimes with legions of lawyers and lobbyists.

I brought up global membership fees as one example, but yes, it doesn't need to be that.

How DAOs are treated in terms of legal compliance would go a long way in terms of defending network state infrastructure legality.

Geographical constraints or political boundaries do not limit their formation.

One critical understanding of network states is that they do not have to be coercive or mandatory, unlike nation-states.

They can and should be voluntary.

The historical root of the network state was philosophical and political, with no technological ingredient.

Professional accountant here, working on a model for decentralised global professional association (will be open source and adaptable to other professions).

Our strategy is to be inclusive of our professional bodies around the world, introducing a merger of qualified people rather than a merger of our bodies, to more effectively coordinate our profession to upskill, standardise and influence government and industry.

However, we'd disintermediate the role and functions of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) which is registered in NY, USA.

I don't think our social-DAO revenue model should require membership fees, however there will be signup fees for the professional bodies and transaction fees generated from member CPE activity.

I'm looking at jurisdictions to launch it from.

It would be interesting to learn about how network and startup societies -- which spawn membership globally -- could legally position themselves and protect themselves amid potentially stifling and conflicting nation state jurisdications as well as compliance measures.

For example, if you were to start a network society as an entity, where do you register, and if you were to accept membership fees, where is that taxed?

Do you find a small developing country and base it on their jurisdiction (e.g.

Palau), do you go to a special zone and fork jurisdication (e.g.

Prospera), do you find a regulation transparent boutique country with global outreach (e.g.

Singapore), or do you stick with where most of your members come from (e.g.

USA)?",discord

Anyone have any appetite/guidance to help pull together a 59 second highlight video with half highlighting vids of the the 6 teachers (Alta, Grace, Akhil, Shara, Brett and myself) and the other time showcasing the 5 pitchers?

I did some podcasting before and looked into common issues and how to avoid them.

This episode has a lot of great advice.

One piece of advice is shipping every guest you do a remote recorded podcast / lecture with a microphone.

Even if they have a great microphone, it's better to have all guests use the same microphone.
