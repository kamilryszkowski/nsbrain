We’ve preparedone sentence,one image,one thousand word, andone essaysummaries of the concepts behind startup societies and network states. Just click those links if you’re impatient. And of course, for the full experience, you can read it one page at a time. Speaking of pages, every section of this book is online and shareable as an individual web page. For example, the URL to this section isthenetworkstate.com/preamble. This allows you to link directly1to any bit of the book for discussion. Moreover, unlike the typical book that’s frozen in time, think of this as a dynamicbookappthat gets continuously updated.

When reading it, think of this work as a toolbox, not a manifesto. You don’t need to agree with all of it to get something out of it. We’ve structured it in modular form for that reason.Chapter 1is an overview of the ideas. Chapters2,3, and4present an analysis that leads to a concerning forecast for the near future, the problem of American Anarchy and Chinese Control. AndChapter 5presents our proposed solution for maintaining liberal values in an illiberal world: startup societies and network states. If you’re a partisan of the US establishment or the CCP, you may not agree with our problem statement at all. If you’re an orthodox Bitcoin maximalist, you likely won’t agree with every aspect of our proposed solution. And if you’re coming in from another school of thought, you may only agree with parts of the problem or solution as we’ve framed them. Nevertheless, we believe there’s enough flexibility in the idea of the network state that you can customize it and make it your own. But what exactlyisa network state?

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. In one informal sentence: A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states. When we think of a nation state, we immediately think of the lands, but when we think of a network state, we should instantly think of the minds. That is, if the nation state system starts with the map of the globe and assigns each patch of land to a single state, the network state system starts with the7+billion humans of the world and attracts each mind to one or more networks. Here’s a more complex definition that extends that concept and pre-emptively covers many edge cases: A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition. OK, that’s a mouthful! It’s lengthy because there are many internet phenomena that share some but not all of the properties of a network state. For example, neither Bitcoin nor Facebook nor a DAO is a network state, because each lacks certain qualities – like diplomatic recognition – which are core to anything we’d think of as the next version of the nation state. (If you want to skip ahead, we expand on each part of the definition inChapter 5. But it’ll make more sense if you read the text all the way through. For what it’s worth, the technical definition of a nation state is similarlymulti-clausal, because it needs to exclude things we don’t typically think about, like stateless nations.)

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. A picture helps. The dashboard above shows what a million-person network state looks like on the map. Specifically, it depicts a network state with 1.7 million people, more than 157 billion dollars in annual income, and a 136 million square meter footprint. The first thing we notice is that a network state isn’t physically centralized like a nation state, nor limited in scale like a city state. It’s geographically decentralized and connected by the internet. The second thing we see is that you could feasibly start this kind of country from your computer. That is, just as Facebook grew from one person’s laptop, a million-person network state that owns a global archipelago of physical territory could start as a one-person startup society, as shown in this gif:thenetworkstate.com/networkstate.gif. The third thing we see is how central the real-time census is to the network state. The dashboard shown combines concepts from coins, companies, and countries to focus a society ongrowthin people, annual income, and real estate footprint. Continued growth is a continuous plebiscite, a vote of confidence by the people inside who remain and those outside who apply. Roughly speaking, a successful network state is one that attracts aligned immigrants, and an unsuccessful network state is one that loses them. That doesn’t mean each network state must grow to infinity, or that all states need accept the same kind of person, but that the community of network states as a whole is focused on building admirable societies that people want to join. Different states will focus on different metrics; imagine a network state premised on improving its citizens’ overalllife expectancy, or one aimed at provably right-shifting theincome distributionfor all. You get what you measure. Next Section: The Network State in One Thousand Words",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Technology has allowed us to start new companies, new communities, and new currencies. But can we use it to create new cities, or even new countries? A key concept is to go cloud first, land last — but not land never — by starting with an online community and then materializing it into the physical world. We get there in seven steps: Found a startup society.This is simply an online community with aspirations of something greater. Anyone can found one, just like anyone can found a company or cryptocurrency.2And the founder’s legitimacy comes from whether people opt to follow them. Organize it into a group capable of collective action.Given a sufficiently dedicated online community, the next step is to organize it into anetwork union. Unlike a social network, a network union has a purpose: it coordinates its members for their mutual benefit. And unlike a traditional union, a network union is not set up solely in opposition to a particular corporation, so it can take a variety of different collective actions.3Unionization is a key step because it turns an otherwise ineffective online community into a group of people working together for a common cause. Build trust offline and a cryptoeconomy online.Begin holding in-person meetups in the physical world, of increasingscale and duration, while simultaneously building an internal economy using cryptocurrency. Crowdfund physical nodes.Once sufficient trust has been built and funds have been accumulated, start crowdfunding apartments, houses,andeventownsto bring digital citizens into the physical world within real co-living communities. Digitally connect physical communities.Link these physical nodes together into anetwork archipelago, a set of digitally connected physical territories distributed around the world. Nodes of the network archipelago range from one-person apartments to in-person communities of arbitrary size.Physical accessis granted by holding a web3 cryptopassport, andmixed realityis used to seamlessly link the online and offline worlds. Conduct an on-chain census.As the society scales, run a cryptographically auditable census to demonstrate the growing size of your population, income, and real-estate footprint. This is how a startup society proves traction in the face of skepticism. Gain diplomatic recognition.A startup society with sufficient scale should eventually be able to negotiate for diplomatic recognition from at least one pre-existing government, and from there gradually increased sovereignty, slowly becoming a truenetwork state. The key idea is to populate the land from the cloud, and do so all over the earth. Unlike an ideologicallydisalignedand geographically centralized legacy state, which packs millions of disputants in one place, a network state is ideologically aligned but geographically decentralized. The people are spread around the world in clusters of varying size, but their hearts are in one place. As the population and economy of a startup society grow comparable to that of a legacy state, with millions of citizens and billions in income, it should eventually4be able to attain recognition from existing sovereigns — and ultimately the United Nations — just as Bitcoin has now become a bona fidenational currency.

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we describe a peaceful, reproducible process for turning an online community premised on a proposition into a physical state with a virtual capital: anetwork state, the sequel to the nation state. We want to be able to peacefully start a new state for the same reason we want a bare plot of earth, a blank sheet of paper, an empty text buffer, a fresh startup, or a clean slate. Because we want to build something new without historical constraint. The financial demand for a clean slate is clear. People buy millions of acres ofvacant landand incorporate hundreds of thousands ofnew companieseach year, spending billions just to get that fresh start. And now that it is possible to start not just new companies but new communities and evennew currencies, we see people flocking to create those as well. The societal value of a clean slate is also clear. In the technology sector alone, the ability to form new companies has created trillions of dollars in wealth over the past few decades. Indeed, if we imagine a world where you couldn’t just obtain a blank sheet of paper but had toerasean older one, where you couldn’t just acquire bare land but had to knock down a standing building, where you couldn’t just create a new company but had to reform an existing firm, we imagine endless conflict over scarce resources. Perhaps we don’t have to think too hard to imagine this world. It resembles our own. In the distant past people could only write onclay tablets, in the recent past they wereexecutedfor contemplating entrepreneurship, and in the immediate present they are arguing over replacing anancient gas station. In these times and places, making a fresh start has been technologically infeasible, politically impossible, or judicially punishable. And that’s where we are today with countries, cities, nations, governments, institutions, and much of the physical world. Because the brand new is unthinkable, we fight over the old. But perhaps we can change that. There are at least six ways to start a new country; three are conventional and three are unconventional. We will introduce them only to deprioritize them all in favor of a seventh. The most conventional way to start a new country involves winning sufficient power in an election to either (a)rewritethe laws of an existing state or (b) carve out anewonefrom scratch with the recognition of the international community. This is the most widely discussed path, and by far the most crowded — perhapstoocrowded. The second obvious way is apoliticalrevolution. We don’t advise attempting this. Particularly momentous elections are sometimes referred to asrevolutions, though a revolution frequently involves bloodshed. Revolutions are infrequent, but everyone knows that they mean a new government. The third conventional way to form a new state is to win a war. We don’t advise attempting this either. A war is, of course, not independent from the other two. Indeed, bothelectionsandrevolutionscan lead towarsthat end up carving outnewpolities. Like a revolution, a war is infrequent and undesirable, but is a means by which to redraw state borders. Now we get to the unconventional. The most obvious of the unconventional approaches – and the one most people think of when they hear the concept of “starting a new country” – occurs when an eccentric plants a flag on anoffshore platformor disputedpatch of dirtand declares themselves king of nothing. If the issue with elections is that toomanypeople care about them, the issue with these so-calledmicronationsis that toofewpeople care. Because a state (like a currency) is an inherently social affair, a few people in the middle of nowhere won’t be able to organize a military, enforce laws, or be recognized by other countries. Moreover, while an existing state may be content to let people harmlessly5LARPafake countryin their backyard, an actual threat to sovereignty typically produces a response with real guns, whether that be theFalklandsorSakhalin. Here is where things start to get interesting. Conceived by Patri Friedman and backed by Peter Thiel,seasteadingessentially starts with the observation that cruise shipsexist, and asks whether we could move from a few weeks on the water at a time to semi-permanent habitation in international waters (with frequent docking, of course). If the cost of cruise shipsfalls, this approach becomes more feasible. But while there are individuals who live on cruise shipsyear-round, we haven’t yet seen a scaled example.6 Perhaps the most prestigious of the start-a-new-country paths is the idea of colonizing other planets. Unlike seasteading or micronations, space exploration started at the government level and has been glamorized in many movies and TV shows, so it enjoys a higher degree of social acceptability. This path is typically received as temporarily technically infeasible, rather than outright crazy. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is one entity seriouslycontemplatingthe logistics of starting a new state on Mars. And finally we arrive at our preferred method: the network state. Our idea is to proceed cloud first, land last. Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with the digital community. We create astartup society, organize it into anetwork union, crowdfund the physical nodes of a network archipelago, and — in the fullness of time — eventually negotiate for diplomatic recognition to become a true networkstate. We build the embryonic state as an open-source project, we organize our internal economy around remote work, we cultivate in-person levels of civility, we simulatearchitecture in VR, and we create art and literature that reflects our values. When we crowdfund territory in the real world, it’s not necessarilycontiguousterritory. Because an under-appreciated fact is thatthe internet allows us to networkenclaves. Put another way, a network archipelago need not acquire all its territory in one place at one time. It can connect a thousand apartments, a hundred houses, and a dozen cul-de-sacs in different cities into a new kind of fractal polity with its capital in the cloud. Community members migrate between these enclaves and crowdfund territory nearby, with every individual dwelling and group house presenting an independent opportunity for expansion. And with a thousand such enclaves, rather than four directions to expand (north, east, south, and west), there are more like four thousand. What we’ve described thus far is much like an ethnic diaspora, in which emigrants are internationally dispersed but connected by communication channels with each other and the motherland. The twist is that our version is areverse diaspora: a community that forms first on the internet, builds a culture online, and only then comes together in-person to build dwellings and structures. In a sense, you can think of each physical outpost of this digital community as acloud embassy, similar to the grassrootsBitcoin embassiesthat have arisen around the world to help people better understand Bitcoin. New recruits can visit either the virtual or physical parts of a network state, beta test it, and decide to leave or stay. Now, with all this talk of embassies and countries one might well contend that network states, like the aforementioned micronations, are also just aLARP. Unlike micronations, however, they are set up to be ascaledLARP, a feat of imagination practiced by large numbers of people at the same time. And the experience of cryptocurrencies over the last decade shows us just howpowerfulsuch a shared LARP can be. Let’s pause and summarize for a second. The main difference between the seventh method (network states) and the previous six (election, revolution, war, micronations, seasteading, and space) is that the seventh straddles the boundary between practicality and impracticality. It is now feasible to build million-person online communities, start billion-dollar digital currencies, andarchitect buildings in VRto then crowdfund into reality. The network state concept stacks together manyexistingtechnologies, rather than requiring the invention of new ones — like Mars-capable rockets, or permanent-habitation seasteads. At the same time, it avoids the obvious pathways of election, revolution, and war – all of which turn ugly, and none of which provide much venue for individual initiative. In other words, the network state takes the most robust existing tech stack we have – namely, the suite of technologies built around the internet – and uses it to route around political roadblocks, without waiting for future physical innovation. Having outlined these seven methods, the careful reader will notice that we have played a bit fast and loose with the definition of what a “new country” is. First, what do wemeanby a new country? One definition is that starting a new country means settling a wholly new territory, like colonizing Mars. Another definition is that simply changing the form of government actually changes the country, like France moving from the Second French Republic to theSecond French Empire. Rather than using either these strict or loose definitions, we will use bothnumericalandsocietaldefinitions of a new country. Thenumericaldefinition begins with visualizing a hypotheticalnationrealestatepop.comsite similar tocoinmarketcap.com, which aggregates the cryptographically audited censuses of startup societies aspiring to become network states. This dashboard would show in realtime the number of community members, the acreage of real estate owned by those members, and the community’s on-chain income. A startup society with five million people worldwide, thousands of square miles of (discontiguous) community-owned land, and billions in annual income would have indisputable numerical significance. This in turn leads us to thesocietaldefinition: a new country is one that isdiplomatically recognizedby other countries as a legitimate polity capable ofself-determination. A state with enough such bilateral relationships would have the societal significance to gain accession to a group of pre-existing states likeASEAN, theOAS, theAfrican Union, the EU, or the United Nations. This combination of numerical and societal metrics matches the emergence of cryptocurrency. Initially ignored, thenmockedas an obvious failure, within five years after its invention Bitcoin attained a billion-dollar market capitalization (anumericalsuccess) and was subsequently listed onCNBCandBloombergalongside blue-chip stocks (a form ofsocietalrecognition). At each step Bitcoin could keep ascending numerically on its own, with greater societal recognition following in its wake. By 2020 it had changed the trajectory of thePeople’s Bank of China,the IMF,Goldman Sachs,JP Morgan, andthe World Bank. By 2021, Bitcoin becamelegal tenderin El Salvador, a sovereign state. And by mid-2022 theCentral African Republichad followed, withdozens moreconsidering Bitcoin as legal tender, includingPanama. Cryptocurrency could achieve these heights because money has both numerical and societal aspects.7The numbers could be piled up before the societal accolades followed. Once Bitcoin had proven that it couldn’t be easily counterfeited or hacked, the shared belief of themillionsof cryptocurrency holders worldwide was enough to get BTC from a value of zero to a market cap of billions, and from there to a listing on every Bloomberg Terminal and exchange. Societal traction of this kind paved the way for more numerical traction, and a virtuous cycle followed. Could a startup society follow a similar path? Yes. Acryptographically auditablecensus could prove that a growing startup society had 1-10M committed digital citizens, large cryptocurrency reserves, years of continuous existence, and physical holdings all over the earth. That numerical traction could then be used to achieve the societal traction of diplomatic recognition. Why? Because most countries are small countries. A new state with a population of 1-10M would actually becomparableto most existing states. That’s because of the193 UN-recognized sovereign states, 20% have a population of less than 1M and 55% have a population of less than 10M. This includes many countries typically thought of as legitimate, such as Luxembourg (615k), Cyprus (1.2M), Estonia (1.3M), New Zealand (4.7M), Ireland (4.8M), and Singapore (5.8M). These “user counts” are surprisingly small by tech standards! Of course, mere quantity is not everything. The strength of affiliation to our hypothetical network state matters, as does thetimeon the property, the percentage ofnet worthstored in the currency, and thefractionof contacts found in the community. Still, once we remember that Facebook has3B+users, Twitter has 300M+, and many individual influencers have1M+followers, it starts to be not too crazy to imagine we can build a 1-10M person startup society with a genuine sense of national consciousness, an integrated cryptocurrency, and a plan to crowdfund many pieces of territory around the world. With the internet, we can digitally sew these disjoint enclaves together into a new kind of polity that achieves diplomatic recognition: anetwork state. Next Section: Prologue",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/prologue,"Title: History as Trajectory
Content: History as TrajectoryChapter 2 Narrated by Balaji AI. Our history is the prologue to the network state. This isnotobvious. Founding a startup society as we’vedescribed itseems to be about growing a community, writing code, crowdfunding land, and eventually attaining the diplomatic recognition to become a network state. What does history have to do with anything? The short version is that if a tech company is about technological innovation first, and company culture second, a startup society is the reverse. It’s about community culture first, and technological innovation second. And while innovating on technology means forecasting the future, innovating on culture means probing the past. But why? Well, for a tech company like SpaceX you start with time-invariant laws of physics extracted from data, laws that tell you how atoms collide and interact with each other. The study of these laws allows you to do something that has never been done before, like landing areusable rocket on a drone ship, seemingly proving that history doesn’t matter. But the subtlety is that these laws of physics encode in highly compressed form the results of innumerable scientific experiments. You are learning from human experience rather than trying to re-derive physical law from scratch. To touch Mars, we stand on the shoulders of giants. For a startup society, we don’t yet have eternal mathematical laws for social groups.8History is the closest thing we have to a physics of humanity. It furnishes many accounts of how human actors collide and interact with each other. The right course of historical study encodes, in compressed form, the results of innumerable social experiments. You can learn from human experience rather than re-deriving societal law from scratch. Learn some history, so as not to repeat it. That’s a theoretical argument. An observational argument is that we know that the technological innovation of the Renaissance began byrediscovering history. And we know that the Founding Fathers cared deeplyabout history. In both cases, they stepped forward by drawing from the past. So if you’re a technologist looking to blaze a trail with a new startup society, that establishes plausibility for why historical study is important. The logistical argument is perhaps the most compelling. Think about how much easier it is to use an iPhone than it was to build Apple from scratch. To consume you can just click a button, but to produce it’s necessary to know something about how companies are built. Similarly, it’s one thing to operate as a mere citizen of a pre-built country, and quite another thing to create one from scratch. To build a new society, it’d be helpful to have some knowledge of how countries were built in the first place, the logistics of the process. And this again brings us into the domain of history. You can’t really learn something without using it. One day of immersion with a new language beats weeks of book learning. One day of trying to build something with a programming language beats weeks of theory, too. In the same way, the history we teach is anappliedhistory: a crucial tool for both the prospective president of a startup society9and for their citizens, shareholders, and staff. It’s something you’ll use on a daily basis. Why? History is how you win the argument.Think about the1619 Project, or thegrievance studiesdepartments at universities, or even a newspaper “profile” of someunfortunate. You might be mining cryptocurrency, but the folks behind such things are mining history. That is, many thousands of people are engaged full time in “offense archaeology,” the excavation of the recent and distant past for some useful incident they can write up to further demoralize their political opposition. This is the scholarly version of going through someone’s old tweets. It’s weaponized history, history asopposition research. You simply can’t win an argument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need history. History determines legality.We denote the exponential improvement in transistor density over the postwar period byMoore’s law. We describe the exponentialdeclinein pharmaceutical R&D efficiency during the same period asEroom’s law— as Moore’s law in reverse. That is, over the last several decades, the FDA somehow presided over an enormous hike in the costs of drug development even as our computers and our knowledge of the human genome vastly improved. Similar phenomena can be observed inenergy(where energy production has stagnated), inaviation(where top speeds have topped out), and inconstruction(where we build slower today than we did seventy years ago). Obviously, even articulating Eroom’s law requires detailed knowledge of history, knowledge of how things used to be. Less obviously, if we want to change Eroom’s law, if we want to innovate in the physical world again, we’ll need history too. The reason is that behind every FDA is athalidomide, just as behind every TSA there’s a 9/11 and behind every Sarbanes-Oxley is anEnron. Regulation is dull, but the incidents that lead to regulation are anything but dull. This history is used to defend ancient regulations; if you change them,people will die!As such, to legalize physical innovation you’ll need to become a counter-historian. Only when you understand the legitimating history of regulatory agencies better than their proponents do can you build a superior alternative: a new regulatory paradigm capable of addressing both the abuses of the American regulatory stateandthe abuses they claim to prevent. History determines morality.Religions start with history lessons. You might think of these as made-up histories, but they’re histories all the same. Tales of the distant past, fictionalized or not, that describe how humans once behaved - and how they should have behaved. There’s a moral to these stories. Political doctrines are based on history lessons too. They’re how the establishment justifies itself. The mechanism for propagating these history lessons is the establishment newspaper, wherein most articles aren’t really about true-or-false, but good-and-bad. Try it yourself. Just by glancing at a headline from any establishment outlet, you can instantly apprehend its moral lesson: x-ism is bad, our system of government is good, tech founders are bad, and so on. And if you poke one level deeper, if you askwhyany of these things is good or bad, you’ll again get a history lesson. Because why is x-ism bad? Well, let meeducateyou on some history… The installation of these moral premises is a zero-sum game. There’s only room for so many moral lessons in one society, because a brain’s capacity for moral computation is limited. So you get a totally different society if 99% of people allocate their limited moral memory to principles like “hard work good, meritocracy good, envy bad, charity good” than if 99% of people have internalized nostrums like “socialism good, civility bad, law enforcement bad, looting good.”10You can try to imagine a scenario where these two sets of moral values aren’t in direct conflict, but empirically those with the first set of moral values will favor an entrepreneurial society and those with the second set of values will not.11 History is how you develop compelling media.You can make up entirely fictional stories, of course. But even fiction frequently has some kind of historical antecedent.The Lord of the Ringsdrew on Medieval Europe, Spaghetti Westerns pulled from the Wild West, Bond movies were inspired by the Cold War, and so on. And certainly the legitimating stories for any political order will draw on history. History is the true value of cryptocurrency.Bitcoin is worth hundreds of billions of dollars because it’s a cryptographically verifiable history of who holds what BTC. ReadThe Truth Machinefor a book-length treatment of this concept. History tells you who’s in charge.Why didOrwellsay that he who controls the past controls the future, and that he who controls the present controls the past? Because history textbooks are written by the winners. They are authored, subtly or not, to tell a story of great triumph by the ruling establishment over its past enemies. The only history most people in the US know is 1776, 1865, 1945, and 1965 - a potted history of revolutions, world wars, and activist movements that lead ineluctably to the sunny uplands of greater political equality.12It’s very similar to the history the Soviets taught their children, where all of the past was interpreted through the lens of class struggle, bringing Soviet citizens to the present day where they wereinevitablyprogressing from the intermediate stage of socialism towards…communism! Chinese schoolchildren learn a similarlyselective historywhere the (real) wrongs of the European colonialists and Japanese are centered, and those of Maodownplayed. And even any successful startup tells a founding story that sands off the rough edges. In short, a history textbook gives you ahero’s journeythat celebrates the triumph of its establishment authors against all odds. Even when a historical treatment covers ostensible victims, like Soviet textbooks covering the victimization of the proletariat, if you look carefully the ruling class that authors that treatment typically justifies itself as thechampionof those victims. This is why one of the first acts of any conquering regime istorewritethetextbooks(click those links), to tell you who’s in charge. History determines your hiring policy.Why are tech companies being lectured by media corporations on “diversity”? Is it because those media corporations that are20-30 points whiterthan tech companies actually deeply care about this? Or is it because after the 2009-eracollapseof print media revenue, media corporationsstruggledfor a business model, found that certainwordsdrove traffic, and then doubled down on that - boosting their stock price and bashing their competitors in the process?13After all, if you know a bitmorehistory, you’ll know that the New York Times Company (which originates so many of these jeremiads) is an organization where the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family literallyprofited from slavery, blockedwomenfrom being publishers,excluded gaysfrom the newsroom for decades, ran asuccession processfeaturing only three cis straightwhite male cousins, and ended up with a publisher who just happened to be the son of the previous guy.14 Suppose you’re a founder. Once you knowthis history, and once all your friends and employees and investors know it, and once you know that no purportedly brave establishment media corporation would haveeverinformed you of it in quite those words15, you’re outside the matrix. You’ve mentally freed your organization. So long as you aren’t running a corporation based on hereditary nepotism where the current guy running the showinheritsthe company from his father’s father’s father’s father, you’re morediverseanddemocraticthan the owners of The New York Times Company. You don’t need to take lectures from them, from anyone in their employ, or really from anyone in their social circle — which includes all establishment journalists. You now have the moral authority to hire who you need to hire, within the confines of the law, asSpaceX,Shopify,Kraken, and others are now doing. And that’s how a little knowledge of history restores control over your hiring policy. History is how you debug our broken society.Many billions of dollars are spent on history in the engineering world. We don’t think about it that way, though. We call it doing a post-mortem, looking over the log files, maybe running a so-calledtime-traveldebugger to get a reproducible bug. Once we find it, we might want to execute an undo, do agit revert, restore from backup, or return to a previously known-good configuration. Think about what we’re saying: on a micro-scale, knowing thedetailed pastof the system allows us to figure out what had gone wrong. And being able to partiallyrewindthe past to progress along a different branch (via agit revert) empowers us to fix that wrongness. This doesn’t mean throwing away everything and returning to the caveman era of a blank git repository, as per either the caricatured traditionalist who wants to “turn back the clock” or theanarcho-primitivistwho wants to end industrialized civilization. But it does mean rewinding a bit to then move forward along a different path16, because progress has both magnitude anddirection. All these concepts apply to debugging situations at larger scale than companies — like societies, or countries.17 You now see why history is useful. A founder of a mere startup company can arguably scrape by without it, tacitly outsourcing the study of history to those who shape society’s laws and morality. But a president of a startup society cannot, because a new society involves moral, social, and legal innovation relative to the old one — and that requires a knowledge of history. We’ve whetted the appetite with some specific examples of why history is useful in general. Now we’ll describe why it’s specifically useful for startup societies. We begin by introducing an operationally useful set of tools for thinking about the past from a bottom-up and top-down perspective: history as written to the ledger, as opposed to history as written by the winners. We use these tools to discuss the emergence of a new Leviathan, the Network, a contender for the most powerful force in the world, a true peer (and complement) to both God and the State as a mechanism for social organization. And then we’ll bring it all together in the lead-up to the key concept of this chapter: the idea of the One Commandment, a historically-founded sociopolitical innovation that draws citizens to a startup society just as a technologically-based commercial innovation attracts customers to a startup company. If a startup begins by identifying an economic problem in today’s market and presenting a technologically-informed solution to that problem in the form of a new company, a startup society begins by identifying a moral issue in today’s culture and presenting a historically-informed solution to that issue in the form of a new society. Wait, why does a startup society have to begin with amoralissue? And why does the solution to that moral issue need to be historically-informed? Can’t it just be a tech-focused community where people solve problems with equations? We’re interested in Mars andlife extension, not dusty stories of defunct cities! The quick answer comes from Paul Johnson at the 11:00 mark ofthis talk, where he notes that early America’s religious colonies succeeded at a higher rate than its for-profit colonies, because the former had a purpose. The slightly longer answer is that in a startup society, you’re not asking people tobuya product (which is an economic, individualistic pitch) but tojoina community (which is a cultural, collective pitch). You’re arguing that the culture of your startup society is better than the surrounding culture; implicitly, that means there’s some moral deficit in the world that you’re fixing. History comes into play because you’ll need to (a) write a study of that moral deficit and (b) draw from the past to find alternative social arrangements where that moral deficit did not occur. Tech may be part of the solution, and calculations may well be involved, but the moment you write about any societal problem in depth you’ll find yourself writing ahistoryof that problem. For specifics, you can skip ahead toExamples of Parallel Societies— or you can suspend disbelief for a little bit, keep reading, and trust us that this historical/moral/ethical angle just might be the missing ingredient to build startup societies, which after all haven’t yet fully taken off in the modern world. Here’s the outline of this chapter. We start with bottom-up history. The section onMicrohistory and Macrohistorybridges the gap between the trajectory of an isolated, reproducible system and the trajectories of millions of interacting human beings. Because both these small and large-scale trajectories can now be digitally recorded and quantified, this is history as written to the ledger — culminating in the cryptohistory of Bitcoin. We next discuss top-down history. This is history as written by the winners, history as conceptualized by what Tyler Cowen calls theBase-Raters, history that justifies the current order and proclaims it stable and inevitable. It is a theory ofPolitical Power vs. Technological Truth. We then talk about the history of power, giving names to the forces we just described by identifying the three candidates for most powerful force in the world:God, State, and Network. Framing things in terms ofthreeprime movers rather than one allows us to generalize beyond purely God-centered religions to understand the Leviathan-centereddoctrinesthat implicitly underpin modern society. We apply this to the history of power struggles. With the God/State/Network lens, we can understand the Blue/Red and Tech-vs-Media conflicts in a different way as a multi-sided struggle betweenPeople of God, People of the State, and People of the Network. We go through how the People of the State have used their power to distort recent and distant history, and how the Network is newly rectifying this distortion in“If the News is Fake, Imagine History.” Having shown the degree to which history has been distorted, and thereby displaced the (implicit) historical narrative in which the arc of history bends to the ineluctable victory of the US establishment18, we discuss several alternative theories of past and future in our section onFragmentation, Frontier, Fourth Turning, and Future Is Our Past. These theses don’t describe a clean progressive victory on every axis, but instead a set of cycles, hairpin turns, and mirror images, a set of historical trajectories far more complex than the narrative of linear inevitability smuggled in through textbooks and mass media. We next turn our attention to left and right, which are confusing concepts in a realigning time, inLeft is the new Right is the new Left. Sorry! We can’t avoid politics anymore. Startup societies aren’t purely about technology. But please note that for the most part this sectionisn’tthe same old pabulum around current events. We do contend that you need a theory of left and right to build a startup society, but that doesn’t mean just picking a side. Why? While a politicalconsumerhas to pick one of a few party platforms off the menu, a politicalfoundercan do something different: ideology construction. To inform this, we’ll show how left and right have swapped sides through history, and how any successful mass movement hasbotha revolutionary left component and a ruling right component. Finally, all of this builds up to the payoff: theOne Commandment. Using the terminology we just introduced, we can rattle it off in a few paragraphs. (If the following is opaque in any way, read the chapter, then come back and re-read this part.) If history is not pre-determined tobendin one direction, if the current establishment may experience dramatic disruption in the form of theFragmentationandFourth Turning, if its power actually arose from the expandingfrontierrather than the expanding franchise, if history is somehow running in reverse as per theFuture Is Our Pastthesis, if the revolutionary and ruling classes are in factswitching sides, if the new Leviathan that is the Network is indeedrising abovethe State, and if the internal American conflicts can be seen not as policy disputes but as holy wars, asclashes of Leviathans…then the assumption of theBase-Ratersthat all will proceed as it always has is quite incorrect! But rather than admit this incorrectness, they’ll attempt to use political power tosuppresstechnological truth. The founder’s counter iscryptohistoryand the startup society. We now have a history no establishment can easily corrupt, the cryptographically verifiable history pioneered by Bitcoin and extended viacrypto oracles. We also have a theory of historicalfeasibility, history as a trajectory rather than an inevitability, the idea that the desirable future will only occur if you put in individual effort. But what exactly is the nature of that desirable future? After all, many groups differ with the old order but also with each other — so a blanket solution won’t work. And could well be resisted. That’s where the One Commandment comes in. As context, the modern person is often morally reticent but politically evangelistic. They hesitate to talk about what is moral or immoral, because it’s not their place to say what’s right. Yet when it comes to politics, this diffidence is frequently replaced by overbearing confidence in how others must live, coupled with an enthusiasm for enforcing their beliefs at gunpoint if necessary. In between this zero and∞, in between eschewing moral discussion entirely and imposing a full-blown political doctrine, in this final section we propose a one: a one commandment. Start a new society with its own moral code, based on your study of history, and recruit people that agree with you to populate it.19We’re not saying you need to come up with your own new Ten Commandments, mind you — but you do needOne Commandmentto establish the differentiation of a new startup society. Concrete examples of possible One Commandments include “24/7 internet bad” (which leads to aDigital Sabbathsociety), or “carbs bad” (which leads to aKeto Koshersociety), or “traditional Christianity good” (which leads to aBenedict Optionsociety), or “life extension good” (which leads to apost-FDAsociety). You might think these One Commandments sound either trivial or unrealistically ambitious, but in that respect they’re similar to tech; the pitch of “140 characters” sounded trivial and the pitch of “reusable rockets” seemed unrealistic, but those resulted in Twitter and SpaceX respectively. The One Commandment is also similar to tech in another respect: itfocusesa startup society on a single moral innovation, just like a tech company is about afocusedtechnoeconomic innovation. That is,as we’ll see, each One Commandment-based startup society is premised on deconstructing the establishment’s history in one specific area, erecting a replacement narrative in its place with a new One Commandment, thenprovingthe socioeconomic value of that One Commandment by using it to attract subscriber-citizens. For example, if you can attract 100k subscribers to your Keto Kosher society through deeply researched historical studies on the obesity epidemic, and then show that they’ve lost significant weight as a consequence, you’ve proven the establishment deeply wrong in a key area. That’ll either drive them to reform — ornotreform, in which case you attract more citizens. A key point is that we can apply all the techniques of startup companies to startup societies. Financing, attracting subscribers, calculating churn, doing customer support — there’s a playbook for all of that. It’s just Society-as-a-Service, the new SaaS. In parallel, other startup societies are likewise critiquing by building, draining citizens away from the establishment with their own historically-informed One Commandments, and thereby driving change on other dimensions. Finally, different successful changes can be copied and merged together, such that the second generation of startup societies starts differentiating from the establishment by two, three, orNcommandments. This is a vision for peaceful, parallelized, historically-driven reform of a broken society. Ok! I know those last few paragraphs involved some heavy sledding, but come back and reread them after going through the chapter. The main point of our little preview here was to make the case that history is anappliedsubject — and that you can’t start a new society without it. Without a genuine moral critique of the establishment, without an ideological root network supported by history, your new society is at best a fancy Starbucks lounge, a gated community that differs only in its amenities, a snack to be eaten by the establishment at its leisure, a soulless nullity with no direction save consumerism.20 Butwithsuch a critique — with the understanding that the establishment is morally wanting, with a focused articulation of how exactly it falls short, with a One Commandment that others can choose to follow, and with a vision of the historical past that underpins your new startup society much as a vision of the technological future underpins a new startup company — you’re well on your way. You might even start to see a historical whitepaper floating in front of you, the scholarly critique that draws your first 100 subscribers, the founding document you publish to kick off your startup society. Now let’s equip you with the tools to write it. Next Section: Microhistory and Macrohistory",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/microhistory-and-macrohistory,"Title: Microhistory and Macrohistory
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. In the bottom-up view, history is written to the ledger. If everything that happened gets faithfully recorded, history is then just the analysis of the log files. To understand this view we’ll discuss the idea of history as a trajectory. Then we’ll introduce the concepts of microhistory and macrohistory, by analogy to microeconomics and macroeconomics. Finally, we’ll unify all this with the new concept of cryptohistory. What happens when you propel an object into the air? The first thing that comes to mind is the trajectory of a ball. Throw it and witness its arc. Just a simple parabola, an exercise in freshman physics. But there are more complicated trajectories. So, how a system evolves with time — its trajectory — can be complex and counterintuitive, even for something small. This is a good analogy for history. If the flight path of a single inanimate object can be this surprising, think about the dynamics of a massive multi-agent system of highly animate people. Imagine billions of humans springing up on the map, forming clusters, careening into each other, creating more humans, and throwing off petabytes of data exhaust the whole way. That’s history. And the timeframes involved make it tough to study. The rock you throw into the air doesn’t take decades to play out its flight path. Humans do. So a historical observer can literally die before seeing the consequences of an action. Moreover, the subjects of the study don’twantto be studied. A mere rock isn’t a stealth bomber. It has neither the motive nor the means to deceive you about its flight path. Humans do. The people under the microscope are fogging the lens. So: the scale is huge, the timeframe is long, and the measurements aren’t just noisy but intentionally corrupted. We can encode all of this into a phrase: history is acryptic epic of twisting trajectories. Cryptic, because the narrators are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic, because the timescales are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your own experience and beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because there are curves, cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And trajectories, because history is ultimately about the time evolution of human beings, which maps to the physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of particles progressing through time. Put that together, and it wipes out both thebase-rater’sview that today’s order will remain basically stable over the short-term, and the complementary view of a long-term “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” It also contests the idea that the fall of the bourgeoisie “and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable,” or that “no two countries on a Bitcoin standard will go to war with each other,” or even that technological progress has been rapid, so we can assume it will continue and society will not collapse. Those phrases come from different ideologies, but each of them verbally expresses the clean parabolic arc of the rock. History isn’t really like that at all. It’s much more complicated. There are certainly trends, and those phrases do identify real trends, but there is alsopushbackto those trends, counterforces that arise in response to applied forces, syntheses that form from theses and antitheses, and outrightcollapses. Complex dynamics, in other words. And how do we study complex dynamical systems? The first task is to measure. Microhistoryis the history of a reproducible system, one which has few enough variables that it can be reset and replayed from the beginning in a series of controlled experiments. It is history as a quantitative trajectory, history as a precise log of measurements. For example, it could be the record of all past values of a state space vector in a dynamical system, the account of all moves made by two deterministic algorithms playing chess against each other, or the chronicle of all instructions executed by a journaling file system after being restored to factory settings. Microhistory is an applied subject, where accurate historical measurement is of direct technical and commercial importance. We can see this with technologies like theKalman filter, which was used for steering the spaceship used in themoon landing. You can see the full technical detailshere, but roughly speaking the Kalman filter uses past measurementsx[t−1],x[t−2],x[t−3]to inform the estimate of a system’s current statex[t], the action that should be takenu[t], and the corresponding prediction of the future statex[t+1]should that action be taken. For example, it uses past velocity, direction headings, fuel levels, and the like to recommend how a space shuttle should be steered at the current timestep. Crucially, if themicrohistoryis not accurate enough, if the confidence intervals around each measurement are too wide, or if (say) the velocity estimate is wrong altogether, then the Kalman Filter does not work andApollodoesn’t happen. At a surface level, the Kalman filter resembles the kind of time series analysis that’s common in finance. The key difference is that the Kalman filter is used onreproduciblesystems while finance is typically anon-reproduciblesystem. If you’re using the Kalman filter to guide a drone from point A to point B, but you have a bug in your code and the drone crashes, you can simply pick up the drone21, put it back on the launch pad at point A, and try again. Because you can repeat the experiment over and over, you can eventually get very precise measurements and a functioning guidance algorithm. That’s a reproducible system. In finance, however, you usually can’t just keep re-running a trading algorithm that makes money and get the same result. Eventually your counterparties will adapt and get wise. A key difference relative to our drone example is the presence of animate objects (other humans) who won’t always do the same thing given the same input.22In fact, they can often be adversarial, observing and reacting to your actions, intentionally confounding your predictions, especially if they can profit from doing so. Past performance is no guarantee of future results in finance, as opposed to physics. Unlike the situation with the drone, a market isn’t a reproducible system. Microhistory thus has its limits, but it’s an incredibly powerful concept. If we have good enough measurements on the past, then we have a better prediction of the future in an extremely literal sense. If we have tight confidence intervals on our measurements of the past, if the probability distributionP(x[t−1])is highly peaked, then we get correspondingly tight confidence intervals on the presentP(x[t])and the futureP(x[t+1]). Conversely, the more uncertainty about your past, the more confused you are about where you’re from and where you’re going, the more likely your rocket will crash. It’s Orwell more literally than he ever expected: he who controls the past controls the future, in the direct sense that he has bettercontrol theory. Only a civilization with a strong capacity for accurate microhistory could ever make it tothe moon. This is a powerful analogy for civilization. A group of people who doesn’t know who they are or where they came from won’t ever make it to the moon, let alone to Mars. Can we make it more than an analogy? Macrohistoryis the history of a non-reproducible system, one which has too many variables to easily be reset and replayed from the beginning. It is history that is not directly amenable to controlled experiment. At small scale, that’s the unpredictable flow of a turbulent fluid; at very large scale, it’s the history of humanity. We think of macrohistory as being on a continuum with microhistory. Why? We’ll make a few points and then tie them all together. First, science progresses by taking phenomena formerly thought of as non-reproducible (and hence unpredictable) systems, isolating the key variables, and turning them into reproducible (and hence predictable) systems. For example,Koch’s postulatesinclude the idea of transmission pathogenesis, which turned the vague concept of infection via “miasma” into a reproducible phenomenon: expose a mouse to a specific microorganism in a laboratory setting and an infection arises, but not otherwise. Second, and relatedly, science progresses by improved instrumentation, by better recordkeeping. Star charts enabled celestial navigation.Johann Balmer’sdocumentation of the exact spacing of hydrogen’s emission spectra led to quantum mechanics.Gregor Mendel’scareful counting of pea plants led to modern genetics. Things we counted as simply beyond human ken — the stars, the atom, the genome — became things humans can comprehend by simply counting. Third, how do we even know anything about the history of ancient Rome or Egypt or Medieval Europe? From artifacts and written records. Thousands of years ago, people were scratching customer reviews intoa stone tablet, one of the first tablet-based apps. We know whoAbelard and Heloisewere from their letters to each other. We know what the Romans were like from what they recorded. To a significant extent, what we know about history is what we’ve recovered from what people wrote down. Fourth, today, we have digital documentation on an unprecedented scale. We have billions of people using social media each day for almost a decade now. We also have billions of phones taking daily photographs and videos. We have countless data feeds of instruments. And we have massive hard drives to store it all. So, if reckoned on the basis of raw bytes, we likely record more information in a day than all of humanity recorded up to the year 1900. It is by far the most comprehensive log of human activity we’ve ever had. We can now see the continuum23between macrohistory and microhistory. We are collecting the kinds of precise, quantitative, microhistorical measurements that typically led to the emergence of a new science…but at the scale of billions of people, and going into our second decade. So, another term for “Big Data” should be “Big History.” All data is a record of past events, sometimes the immediate past, sometimes the past of months or years ago, sometimes (in the case of Google Books or the Digital Michelangelo project) the past of decades or centuries ago. After all, what’s another word for data storage in a computer?Memory. Memory, as in the sense of human memory, and as in the sense of history. That memory is commercially valuable. A technologist who neglects history ensures their users will get exploited. Proof? Consider reputation systems. Any scaled marketplace has them. Thehistoryof an Uber driver or rider’s on-platform behavior partially predicts their future behavior. Without years of star ratings, without memories of past actions of millions of people, these platforms would be wrecked by fraud. Macrohistory makes money. This is just one example. There are huge short and long-term incentives to record all this data, all this microhistory and macrohistory. And future historians24will study our digital log to understand what we were like as a civilization. There are some catches to the concept of digital macrohistory, though: silos, bots, censors, and fakes. As we’ll show, Bitcoin and its generalizations provide a powerful way to solve these issues. First, let’s understand the problems of silos, bots, censors, and fakes. The macrohistorical log is largely siloed across different corporate servers, on the premises of Twitter and Facebook and Google. The posts are typically not digitally signed or cryptographically timestamped, so much of the content is (or could be) from bots rather than humans. Inconvenient digital history can be deleted by putting sufficient pressure on centralized social media companies or academic publishers, censoring true information in the name of taking down “disinformation,” as we’ve already seen. And the advent of AI allows highly realistic fakes of the past and present to be generated. If we’re not careful, we could drown in fake data. So, how could someone in the future (or even the present) know if a particular event they didn’t directly observe was real? The Bitcoin blockchain gives one answer. It is the most rigorous form of history yet known to man, a history that is technically and economically resistant to revision. Thanks to a combination of cryptographic primitives and financial incentives, it is very challenging to falsify the who, what, and when of transactions written to the Bitcoin blockchain. Who initiated this transfer, what amount of Bitcoin did they send, what metadata did they attach to the transaction, and when did they send it? That information is recorded in the blockchain and sufficient to give a bare bones history of the entire Bitcoin economy since 2009. And if you sum up that entire history to the present day, you also get the values of how much BTC is held by each address. It’s an immediatist model of history, where the past is not even past - it’s with us at every second. In a little more detail,whyis the Bitcoin blockchain so resistant to the rewriting of history? To falsify the “who” of a single transaction you’d need to fake adigital signature, to falsify the “what” you’d need to break ahash function, to falsify the “when” you’d need to corrupt atimestamp, and you’d need to do this while somehow not breaking all the other records cryptographically connected to that transaction through the mechanism of composedblock headers. Some call the Bitcoin blockchain atimechain, because unlike many other blockchains, itsproof-of-workmechanism and difficulty adjustment ensure a statistically regular time interval between blocks, crucial to its function as a digital history. (I recognize that these concepts and some of what follows is technical. Our whirlwind tour may provoke either familiar head-nodding or confused head-scratching. If you want more detail, we’ve linked definitions of each term, but fully explaining them is beyond the scope of this work. However, seeThe Truth Machinefor a popular treatment and Dan Boneh’sCryptography coursefor technical detail.) Nevertheless, here’s the point for even a nontechnical reader: the Bitcoin blockchain gives ahistory that’s hard to falsify. Unless there’s an advance in quantum computing, a breakthrough in pure math, a heretofore unseen bug in the code, or a highly expensive51% attackthatprobably only Chinacould muster, it is essentially infeasible to rewrite the history of the Bitcoin blockchain — or anything written to it. And even if such an eventdoeshappen, it wouldn’t be an instantaneous burning of Bitcoin’s Library of Alexandria. The hash function could be replaced with a quantum-safe version, or another chain robust to said attack could take Bitcoin’s place, and back up the ledger of all historical Bitcoin transactions to a new protocol. With that said, we are not arguing that Bitcoin is infallible. We are arguing that it is the best technology yet invented for recording human history. And if the concept of cryptocurrency can endure past the invention of quantum decryption, we will likely think of the beginning of cryptographically verifiable history as on par with the beginning of written history millennia ago. Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD as the year 13 AS, with “After Satoshi” as the new “Anno Domini,” and theblock clockas the new universal time. For the price of a single transaction, the Bitcoin blockchain can be generalized to provide a cryptographically verifiable record of any historical event, aproof-of-existence. For example, perhaps there is some off-chain event of significant importance where you want to store it for the record. Suppose it’s thefamous photo of Stalinwith his cronies, because you anticipate the rewriting of history. The proof-of-existence technique we’re about to describe wouldn’t directly be able to prove thedataof the file was real, but you could establish themetadataon the file — the who, what, and when — to a future observer. Specifically, given a proof-of-existence, a future observer would be able to confirm that a given digital signature (who) put a given hash of a photo (what) on chain at a given time (when). That future observer might well suspect the photo could still be fake, but they’d know it’d have to be faked at that precise time by the party controlling that wallet. And the evidence would be on-chain years before the airbrushed official photo of Stalin was released. That’s implausible under many models. Who’d fake something so specific years in advance? It’d be more likely the official photo was fake than the proof-of-existence. So, let’s suppose that this limited level of proof was worth it to you. You are willing to pay such that future generations can see an indelible record of a bit of history. How would you get that proof onto the Bitcoin blockchain? The way you’d do this is by organizing your arbitrarily large external dataset (a photo, or something much larger than that) into aMerkle tree, calculating a string of fixed length called aMerkle root, and then writing that to the Bitcoin blockchain throughOP_RETURN. This furnishes a tool for proof-of-existence for any digital file. You can do this as a one-off for a single piece of data, or as a periodic backup for any non-Bitcoin chain. So you could, in theory, put a digital summary of many gigabytes of data from another chain on the Bitcoin blockchain every ten minutes for the price of a single BTC transaction, thereby proving it existed. This would effectively “back up” this other blockchain and give it some of the irreversibility properties of Bitcoin. Call this kind of chain asubchain. By analogy to theindustrial use of gold, this type of “industrial” use case of a Bitcoin transaction may turn out to be quite important. A subchain with many millions of off-Bitcoin transactions every ten minutes could likely generate enough economic activity to easily pay for a single Bitcoin transaction.25 And as more people try to use the Bitcoin blockchain, given its capacity limits, it might turn out thatonlyindustrial use cases like this could afford to pay sufficient fees in this manner, as direct individual use of the Bitcoin blockchain could become expensive. So, that means we can use the proof-of-existence technique to log arbitrary data to the Bitcoin blockchain, including data from other chains. We just zoomed in to detail how you’d log a single transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain to prove any given historical event happened. Now let’s zoom out. As noted, the full scope of what the Bitcoin blockchain represents is nothing less than the history of an entire economy. Every transaction is recorded sincet=0. Every fraction of a BTC is accounted for, down to one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Nothing is lost. Except, of course, for all the off-chain data that accompanies a transaction - like the identity of the sender and receiver, the reason for their transaction, the SKU of any goods sold, and so on. There are usually good reasons for these things to remain private, or partially private, so you might think this is a feature. The problem is that Bitcoin’s design is a bit of a tweener, as it doesn’t actually ensure that public transactions remain private. Indeed there are companies likeEllipticandChainalysisdevoted entirely to the deanonymization of public Bitcoin addresses and transactions. The right model of the history of the Bitcoin economy is that it’s in a hybrid state, where the public has access to the raw transaction data, but private actors (like Chainalysis and Elliptic) have access to much more information and can deanonymize many transactions. Moreover, Bitcoin canonlyexecute Bitcoin transactions, rather than all the other kinds of digital operations you could facilitate with more blockspace. But people are working on all of this. What’s the point? Ifblockspacecontinues to increase, ever more of the digital history of our economy and society will be recorded on chain, in a cryptographically verifiable yet privacy-preserving way. The analogy is to the increase in bandwidth, which now allows us to download a megabyte of JavaScript on a mobile phone to run a webapp, an unthinkable indulgence in the year 2000. This is a breakthrough in digital macrohistory that addresses the issues of silos, bots, censors, and fakes. Public blockchains aren’t siloed in corporations, but publicly accessible. They provide new tools, like staking and ENS-style identity, that allow separation of bots from humans. They can incorporate many different proof techniques, including proof-of-existence and more, to address the problem of deepfakes. And they can have very strong levels of censorship resistance by paying transaction fees to hash their chain state to the Bitcoin blockchain. We can now see how the expansion of blockspace is on track to give us acryptographically verifiable macrohistory, or cryptohistory for short. This is the log of everything that billions of people choose to make public: every decentralized tweet, every public donation, every birth and death certificate, every marriage and citizenship record, every crypto domain registration, every merger and acquisition of an on-chain entity, every financial statement, every public record — all digitally signed, timestamped, and hashed in freely available public ledgers.26 The thing is, essentially all of human behavior has a digital component now. Every purchase and communication, every ride in an Uber, every swipe of a keycard, and every step with a Fitbit — all of that produces digital artifacts. So, in theory you could eventually download the public blockchain of a network state to replay the entire cryptographically verified history of a community.25That’s the future of public records, a concept that is to the paper-based system of the legacy state what paper records were to oral records. It’s also a vision for what macrohistory will become. Not a scattered letter from an Abelard here and a stone tablet from an Egyptian there. But a full log, a cryptohistory. The unification of microhistory and macrohistory in one giant cryptographically verifiable dataset. We call this indelible, computable, digital, authenticatable history theledger of record. This concept is foundational to the network state. And it can be used for good or ill. In decentralized form, the ledger of record allows an individual to resist theStalinist rewritingof the past. It is the ultimate expression of the bottom-up view of history as what’s written to the ledger. But you can also imagine a bastardized form, where the cryptographic checks are removed, the read/write access is centralized, and the idea of a total digital history is used by a state to create an NSA/China-like system of inescapable, lifelong surveillance.27 This in turn leads us to a top-down view of history, the future trajectory we want to avoid, where political power is used to defeat technological truth. Next Section: Political Power and Technological Truth",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/political-power-and-technological-truth,"Title: Political Power and Technological Truth
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. In the top-down view, history is written by the winners. It is about political power triumphing over technological truth. Why does power care about the past? Because the morality of society is derived from its history. When the Chinese talk about Western imperialism, they aren’t just talking about some forgettable dust-up in the South China Sea, but how that relates to generations of colonialism and oppression, to the Eight Nations Alliance and the Opium Wars and so on. And when you see someone denounced on American Twitter as anx-ist, history is likewise being brought to bear. Again, why are they bad? Because of our history of x-ism… As such, when you listen to a regime’s history, which you are doing every time you hear its official organs praise or denounce someone, you should listen critically. How do the authorities use history? What techniques are they using? It’s not just a random collection of names and dates. They have proven techniques for sifting through the archives, for staffing a retinue of heros and villains from the past, for distilling the documents into (politically) useful parables. Here are two of them. Political determinist model: history is written by the winners.People have heard this saying, but taking it seriously has profound implications. For example, whoever claims to be writing the “first draft of history” is therefore one of the winners. For another, history is what’s useful to the regime. A classic example isKatyn Forest: the admission that the Soviets did it would have delegitimized their postwar control over Poland during the 1945-1991 period, but once the USSR collapsed the truth could be revealed. Political mascot model: history is written by winners pretending to be acting on behalf of losers.This is a variant of the political determinist model, also known as “offense archaeology,” and practiced by the modern American, Chinese, and Russian establishments — all of whom portray themselves as victims. The technique is to pick a mascot that the stateclaimsto champion, such as the Soviet Union’s proletariat, and then go through history to find the worst examples of the state’s current rival doing something bad to them. Take these real events, put them on the front page, and ensure everyone knows of them. Conversely, ensure off-narrative events are ignored or suppressed as taboo. Again taking the USSR as a case study, this involved finding endless (real!) examples of Western capitalists screwing the working class, and suppressing the worse (also real!) instances of Soviet communists gulagingtheirworking class, as well as cases of the working class itself behaving badly. Generalization to other contexts is left as an exercise for the reader, but here’s aRussian exampleof what an American would call “responsibility to protect” (R2P). These techniques are used to write history that favors a state. Here are more examples: CCP China: Today’s Chinese media covers the Eight-Nations Alliance, the Opium Wars, and the like exhaustively in its domestic output, as these events show the malevolence of the European colonialists — who literally fought wars to keep China subjugated and addicted to heroin. Their domestic history does not mention the Uighurs, Tiananmen, and the like domestically. Xi’s CCP did stress the domestic problem of corruption via the “Tigers and Flies” campaign…but that’s in part because the anti-corruption campaign waspolitically usefulagainst his internal enemies, and seemed not to ensnare his allies. US Establishment: Today’s US establishment covers 6/4/1989 and the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War heavily, because they are real events that make China and Russia look bad and the US look good. It does not mention the1900 Eight-Nations Alliance(when the US helped invade China with a “coalition of the willing” to defend European imperialism) or the1932 Ukrainian Holodomor(when The New York Times Company’s Walter Duranty helped Soviet Russia choke out Ukraine) as these cut in the opposite direction. The current US narrative also does not stress theCultural Revolution(which bears too close a resemblance to present day America), or Western journalists likeEdgar Snowwho helped Mao come to power, or the full ugly history ofAmericansupportforRussianandChinesecommunism. This isn’t simply a matter of the age of events — after all, regime media goes back further in time when convenient,distortingeventsfrom1619for today’s headlines, yet somehow their time machine stutters on the years 1932 or 1900. In modern America, as in modern China, the history you hear about is the history the establishment finds to be politically useful against its internal and external rivals. The British Empire: The British in both WW1 and WW2 understandably emphasized the evils of Germany, but not so much the evils of theirally Russia, or their own evils during the Opium Wars, or the desire for the Indian subcontinent to breathe free, and so on. (This one is almost too easy as the UK is no longer a contender for heavyweight champion of the world, so no one is offended when someone points out its past self-serving inconsistencies. Indeed, documenting the UK’s sins is now a cottage industry for Britain’s virtue signalers, as beating up on a beaten empire is far easier than tackling the taboos of a still live one.) Point being: once you get your head out of the civilization you grew up in, and look at things comparatively, the techniques of political history become obvious. One of those techniques deserves special mention, and that’s a peacetime version of the “atrocity story”: One of the most time-honored techniques to mobilize public animosity against the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This technique, says Professor Lasswell, has been used “with unvarying success in every conflict known to man.” The concept is as useful in peacetime as it is in war. Why? Because states get their people hyped up to fight wars by stressing the essentially defensive nature of what they are doing and the savage behavior of the enemy. But war is politics by other means, so politics is war by other means. Even in peacetime, the state is predicated on force. And this use of force requires justification. The atrocity story is the tool used to convince people that the use of state force is legitimate. Coming from a different vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a “founding murder.” Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat toned-down versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to justify expansions of political power. Indeed, almost everything in politics is backed by an atrocity story.28There’s a sometimes real, sometimes fake, sometimes exaggerated Girardian founding murder (or at least founding injury) behind much of what the government does. Sometimes the atrocity story isframedin terms of terrorists, sometimes in terms of children…but the general concept is “something so bad happened, we must use (state) force to prevent it from happening again.” Often this completely ignores the death caused by that force itself. For example, when the FDA “prevented” deaths by cracking down on drug approvals after thalidomide, it caused many more deaths viaEroom’s Lawanddrug lag. And sometimes the atrocity story is just completely fake; before Iraq was falselyaccused of holding WMD, it was falsely accused of tossingbabies from incubators. With that said, it’s possible to overcorrect here. Just because there is an incentive to fake (or exaggerate) atrocities does not mean thatallatrocities are fake or exaggerated.29Yes, you should be aware that states are always “flopping,” exaggerating the severity of the fouls against them or the mascots they claim to represent, trying to bring in the public on their side, whether they are Chinese or American or Russian. But once you’re aware of the political power model of history, the next goal is to guard against both theScylla and the Charybdis, against being too credulousandtoo cynical. Because just as the atrocity story is a tool for political power, unfortunately so too is genocide denial — as we can see from The New York Times’Pulitzer-winning coverup of Stalin’s Ukrainian famine. To maintain this balance, to know when states are lying or not, we need a form of truth powerful enough to stand outside any state and judge it from above. A way to respond to official statistics not with either reflexive faith or disbelief, but with dispassionate, independent calculation. The bottom-up cryptohistory we introduced in the previous section is clearly relevant. But to fully appreciate it we need an allied theory: the technological truth theory of history. The political power model of history gives us a useful lens: historyisoften just Leninist who/whom and Schmittian friend/enemy. But it’s a little parched30to say that history is always and only that,solelyabout the raw exercise of political power. After all, a society must pass down true facts about nature, for example, or else its crops will not grow31— and its political class willlosepower. This leads to a different set of tech-focused lenses for analyzing history. Technological determinist model: technology is the driving force of history. While the political determinist model stresses that history is written — and hence distorted — by the winners, and thereby propagates only that which is useful to a given state, the technological determinist model notes that there are some key areas — principally in science and technology — where many (if not most) societies derive a benefit from passing down a technical factwithoutdistortion. There is after all an unbroken chain from Archimedes, Aryabhata, Al-Kwarizhmi, and antiquity to all our existing science and technology. Hundreds of years later, we don’t care that much about the laws of Isaac Newton’s time, but we do care about Newton’s laws. In this model, all political ideologies have been around for all time — the only thing that changes is whether a given ideology is now technologically feasible as an organizing system for humanity. Thus: political fashions just come and go in cycles, so the absolute measure of societal progress is a culture’s level of technological advancement on something like theKardashev scale. Trajectory model: histories are trajectories.We mentioned this concept before when we discussedhistory as a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories, but it’s worth reprising. If you’re technically inclined, you might wonder why we spend so much time on history in this book. One answer is that histories are trajectories of dynamical systems. If you can spend your entire life studying wave equations, diffusion equations, time series, or the Navier-Stokes equations — and you can — you can do the same for the dynamics of people. In more detail, we know from physics (and Stephen Wolfram!) that very simple rules can produce incredibly complicated trajectories of dynamical systems. For Navier-Stokes, for example, we can divide these trajectories up into laminar flow, turbulent flow, inviscid flow, incompressible flow, and so on, to describe different ways a velocity field can evolve over time. These classifications are derived from measurements made of fluids over time. And the study of just one of these trajectory types can be a whole research discipline. That’s how rich the dynamics of inanimate objects are. Now compare that to the macroscopic movements of millions of intelligent agents. You can similarly try to derive rules about how humans behave under situations of laminar good times, turbulent revolutionary times, and so on by studying the records we have of human behavior — the data exhaust that humans produce. This analogy is actually very tight if you think about virtual economies and the history of human behavior on social networks and cryptosystems. In the fullness of time, with truly open datasets, we may even be able to develop Asimovian psychohistory from all the data recorded in the ledger of record, namely a way to predict the macroscopic behavior of humans in certain situations without knowing every microscopic detail. We can already somewhat do this for constructed environments like games32and markets, and ever more human environments are becoming literally digitally constructed.33 Statistical model: history aids predictions. From a statistician’s perspective, history is necessary for accurately computing the future. See any time series analysis or machine learning paper — or the Kalman filter, which makes this concept very explicit. To paraphrase Orwell, without a quantitatively accurate record of the past you cannot control the future, in the sense that your control theory literally won’t work. Helix model: linear and cyclical history can coexist. From a progressive’s perspective, history is a linear trend, where the “arc of history” bends towards freedom, and where those against a given cause are on the wrong side of history34. Others think of history as cyclical, a constant loop where the only thing these technologists are doing is reinventing the wheel, or where “strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, and hard times create strong men.” But there’s a third view, a helical view of history, which says that from one viewpoint history is indeed progressive, from another it’s genuinely cyclical, and the reconciliation is that we move abit forwardtechnologically with each turn of the corkscrew rather than collapsing. In this view, attempts to restore the immediate preceding state are unlikely, as they’re rewinding the clock — but you might be able to get to a good state by winding the helix all the way past 12’o’clock to get the reboot. Or you might just collapse. Ozymandias model: civilization can collapse.History shows us that technological progress is not inevitable.The Fall of Civilizations podcastreally makes this clear.Gobekli Tepeis one example. Whether you’re thinking of this as an astronomer (where are all the intelligent life forms out there? Is the universea dark forest?) or an anthropologist (how did all these advanced civilizations just completely die out?), it’s sobering to think that our civilization may just be like the best player in a video game so far: we’ve made it the furthest, but we have no guarantee that we’re going to win before killing ourselves35and wiping out like all the other civilizations before us. Lenski model: organisms are not ordinal.Richard Lenskiran a famous series of long-term evolution experiments with E. coli where he picked out a fresh culture of bacteria each day, froze it down in suspended animation, and thereby saved a snapshot of what each day of evolution looked like over the course of decades. The amazing thing about bacteria is that they can be unfrozen and reanimated, so Lenski could take an old E. coli strain from day 1173 and put it into a test tube with today’s strain to see who’d reproduce the most in a head-to-head competition. Theresultshowed thathistory is not strictly ordinal; just because the day 1174 strain had outcompeted the day 1173 strain, and the day 1175 strain had outcompeted the day 1174 strain, and so on — doesnotnecessarily mean that today’s strain will always win a head to head with the strain from day 1173. The complexity of biology is such that it’s more like an unpredictable game of rock/paper/scissors. Train Crash model: those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.Another way to think about history is as a set of expensive experiments, where people often made certain choices that seemed reasonable at the time and ended up in calamitous straits. That’s communism, for example: a persuasive idea for many, but one that history shows to not actually producegreat resultsin practice. Idea Maze model: those who overfit to history will never invent the future.This is the counterargument to the Train Crash model — past results may not predict future performance, and sometimes you need to have a beginner’s mindset to innovate. Generally this works better for opt-in technologies and investments than top-down modifications of society like communism. One tool for this comes from a concept I wrote up a while ago called theidea maze. The relevant bit here is that just because a business proposition didn’t work in the past doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t work today. The technological and social prerequisites may have dramatically changed, and doors previously closed may now have opened. Unlike the laws of physics, society is not time invariant. As even the world’s leading anti-tech blogonce admitted: Virtual reality was an abject failure right up to the moment it wasn’t. In this way, it has followed the course charted by a few other breakout technologies. They don’t evolve in an iterative way, gradually gaining usefulness. Instead, they seem hardly to advance at all, moving forward in fits and starts, through shame spirals and bankruptcies and hype and defensive crouches — until one day, in a sudden about-face, they utterly, totally win. Wright-Fisher model: history is what survives natural selection.In population genetics, there’s an important model of how mutations arise and spread called theWright-Fisher model. When a new mutation arises, it’s in only 1 out of N people. How does it get to N out of N, to 100%, to what’s called “fixation”? Well, first, it might not ever do that. It might just die out. It might also get to N out of N simply by luck, if the population of N is small — this is known as “fixation by genetic drift,” where those with the mutation just happen to reproduce more than others. But if the mutation confers some selective advantages, if it aids in the reproduction of its host in a competitive environment, then it has a better than luck chance of getting to 100%. Similarly, those historical ideas that we’ve heard about can be thought of as those that aided or at least did not interfere with the propagation of their respective carriers, often the authorities that write those histories. Some of these ideas have tagged along by dumb luck, while others are claims that were selectively advantageous to the success of the regime - often by delegitimizing their rivals and legitimizing their own rule, or by giving them new technologies. This is a theory of memetic evolution; the ideological mutations that add technological edge or political power are the ones selected for. Computational model: history is the on-chain population; all the rest is editorialization. There’s a great book by Franco Moretti calledGraphs, Maps, and Trees. It’s a computational study of literature. Moretti’s argument is that every other study of literature is inherently biased. The selection of which books to discuss is itself an implicit editorialization. He instead makes this completely explicit by creating a dataset of full texts, and writing code to produce graphs. The argument here is that only a computational history can represent the full population in a statistical sense; anything else is just a biased sample. Genomic model: history is what DNA (and languages, and artifacts) show us.David Reich’sWho We Are and How We Got Hereis the canonical popular summary of this school of thought, along with Cavalli-Sforza’s older book on theHistory and Geography of Human Genes. The brief argument is: our true history is written in our genes. Mere texts can be faked, distorted, or lost, but genomics (modern or ancient) can’t be. Languages and artifacts are a bit less robust in terms of the signal for historical reconstruction, though they often map to what the new genomic studies are showing about patterns of ancient migrations. Tech Tree model: history is great men constrained by the adjacent possible. As context, the great man theory of history says that individuals like Isaac Newton and Winston Churchill shaped events. The counterargument says that these men were carried on tides larger than them, and that others would have done the same in their place. For example, for many (not all) Newtons, there is aLeibniz, who could also have invented calculus. It’s impossible tofullytest either of these theories without a Lenski-like experiment where we re-run history with the same initial conditions, but a useful model to reconcile the two perspectives is thetech treefromCivilization. Briefly, all known science represents the frontier of the tree, and an individual canchooseto extend that tree in a given direction. There wasn’t really a Leibniz for Satoshi, for example; at a time when others were focused on social, mobile, and local, he was working on a completely different paradigm. But hewasconstrained by the available subroutines, concepts like Hashcash and chained timestamps and elliptic curves. Just like da Vinci could have conceived a helicopter, but probably not built it with the materials then available, the tech tree model allows for individual agency but subjects it to the constraint of what is achievable by one person in a given era. The major advantage of a tech tree is that (like the idea maze) it can be madevisible, and navigable, as has been done forlongevity by the Foresight Institute. You might find it a bit surprising that there are as many different models for understanding history — let’s call themhistorical heuristics— as there are programming paradigms. Why might this be so? Well, just like the idea ofstatecraft strategiesthat we introduce later, the study of history can also be analogized to a type of programming, or at least data analysis. That is, history is the analysis of thelog files. Data exhaust model: history as the analysis of the log files. Here, we mean “log files” in the most general sense of everything society has written down or left behind; the documents, yes, but also the physical artifacts and genes and artwork, just like a log “file” can contain binary objects and not just plain text. Extending the analogy, you can try to debug a program by flying blind without the logs, or alternatively you can try to look at every row of the logs, but rather than either of these extremes you’ll do best if you have a method fordistillingthe logs into something actionable. And that’s why historical heuristics exist. They are strategies for distilling insight from all the documents, genes, languages, transactions, inventions, collapses, and successes of people over time. History is the entire record of everything humanity has done. It’s a very rich data structure that we have only begun to even think ofasa data structure. We can now think of written history as an (incomplete, biased, noisy) distillation of this full log. After all, if you’ve ever found a reporter’s summary of an eyewitness video to be wanting, or found a single video misleading relative to multiple camera angles, you’ll realize why having access to thefulllog of public events is a huge step forward. We’ve now defined a top-down and bottom-up model of history. The collision of these two models, of the establishment’s Orwellian relativism36and the absolute truth of the Bitcoin blockchain, of political power and technological truth…that collision is worth studying. Let’s do three concrete examples where political power has encountered technological truth. In the first and second examples, the employees of the New York Times Company simply misrepresented the facts as they are wont to do, circulating assertions that were politically useful against two of their perennial opponents: the tech founder and the foreign conservative. Whether these misrepresentations were made intentionally or out of “too good to check” carelessness, they were both attempts to exercise political power that ran into the brick wall of technological truth. In the third example, the Chinese political systemdelegatedthe job of finding out what was true to the blockchain. In all three cases, technology provided a more robust means of determining what was true than the previous gold standards — whether that be the “paper of record” or the party-state. It decentralized the determination of truth away from the centralized establishment. It isn’t always possible to decentralize the determination of truth away from a political establishment. Some truths are intrinsically relative (and hence political), whereas others are amenable to absolute verification (and hence technological). Here’s the key: is it true if others believe it to be true, or is it true regardless of what people believe? A political truth is true if everyone believes it to be true. Things like money, status, and borders are in this category. You can change these by rewriting facts in people’s brains. For example, the question of what a dollar is worth, who the president is, and where the border of a country is are all dependent on the ideas installed in people’s heads. If enough people change their minds, markets move, presidents change, and borders shift.37 Conversely, a technical truth is true even if no human believes it to be true. Facts in math, physics, and biochemistry are in this category. They exist independent of what’s in people’s brains. For example, what’s the value ofπ, the speed of light, or the diameter of a virus?38 Those are the two extremes: political truths that you can change by rewriting the software in people’s brains, and technical truths that exist independent of that. Once you reluctantly recognize that noteveryaspect of a sociopolitical order can be derived from an objective calculation, and that some things reallydodepend on an arbitrary consensus, you realize that we need to maintain a balance between political power and technological truth.39 Towards this end, the Chinese have a pithy saying: thebackwards will be beaten. If you’re bad at technology, you’ll be beaten politically. Conversely, the Americans also have a saying: “you and what army?” It doesn’t matter how good you are as an individual technologist if you’re badly outnumbered politically. And if you’re unpopular enough, you won’t have the political power to build in the physical world. Combining these views tells us to seek a balance betweennationalism and rationalism, where the former is thought of in the broadest sense as “group identity.” It’s a balance between political power and technological truth, between ingroup-stabilizingnarrativesand inconvenient facts. And you need both. So that’s how the political and technological theories of history interrelate. Technological history is the history of what works; political history is the history of what works to retain power. Putting all the pieces together: Can we generalize these observations into a broader thesis, into an overarching theory that includes the clash of political power and technological truth as a special case? We can. And that leads us to a discussion of God, State, and Network. Next Section: God, State, Network",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. The collision between the top-down and bottom-up views of history, between history as written by the winners and history as written to the ledger, between political power and technological truth…that encounter is a collision of Leviathans. To understand this, imagine two schoolboys fighting on a playground. It’s not long before one of them says “my dad can beat up your dad!” There’s profundity in this banality. Even at a very young age, a child believes he can appeal to a higher power, a Leviathan, a powerful man who can sweep the field of his enemies, including Robert from recess. Men are not so different from children in this regard. Every doctrine has its Leviathan, that prime mover who hovers above all. For a religion, it is God. For a political movement, it is the State. And for a cryptocurrency, it is the Network. These three Leviathans hover over fallible men to make them behave in pro-social ways. Once we generalize beyond God, once we realize there’s not one butthreeLeviathans in aHobbesiansense, much becomes clear. Movements that aren’t God-worshipping religions are often State-worshipping political movements or Network-worshipping crypto tribes. Many progressive atheists are by no means astatists; they worship the State as if it were God. And many libertarian atheists may not believe in either Godorthe State, but they do believe in the Network - whether that be their social network or their cryptocurrency. This deserves some elaboration. The first Leviathan was God. In the 1800s, people didn’t steal because they actuallyfearedGod. They believed in a way that’s hard for us to understand, they thought of God as an active force in the world, firing-and-brimstoning away. They wanted god-fearing men in power, because a man who genuinely believed in God would behave well even if no one could punish him. That is, a powerful leader who actually believed that eternal damnation was the punishment for violating religious edicts could be relied upon by the publiceven ifno human couldseewhether he had misbehaved. At least, this is a rational retrofitting of why being genuinely “god-fearing” was important to people, though they might not articulate it in quite that way. God was the ultimate force, the Leviathan. By the late 1800s, Nietzsche wrote that “God is dead.” What he meant is that a critical mass of the intelligentsia didn’t believe in God anymore, not in the same way their forefathers did. In the absence of God, a new Leviathan now rose to pre-eminence, one that existed before but gained new significance: the State. And so in the 1900s, why didn’t you steal? Because even if you didn’t believe in God, the State would punish you. The full global displacement of God by the State (something already clearly underway in Francesince 1789) led to the giant wars of the 20th century, Democratic Capitalism vs Nazism vs Communism. These new faiths replaced g-o-d with g-o-v, faiths which centered the State over God as the most powerful force on earth. That brings us to the present. Now, today, as you can see fromthis graphandthis one, it is not just God that is dead. It is the State that is dying. Because here in the early innings of the 21st century,faithin the State is plummeting. Faith in God hascrashedtoo, though there may be some inchoate revival of religious faithpending. But it is the Network — the internet, the social network, and now the crypto network — that is the next Leviathan. So: in the 1800s you wouldn’t steal because God would smite you, in the 1900s you didn’t steal because the State would punish you, but in the 2000s you can’t steal because the Network won’t let you.40Either the social network will mob you, or the cryptocurrency network won’t let you steal because you lack the private key, or (eventually) the networked AI will detect you, or all of the above. Put another way, what’s the most powerful force on earth? In the 1800s, God. In the 1900s, the US military. And by the mid-2000s, encryption. Because as Assange put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math problems. So it doesn’t matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property or information is secured by cryptography, the state can’t seize it without getting the solution to an equation. Now, the obvious response is that a state like Venezuela can still try tobeat someone upto get that solution, do the proverbialrubber hoseattack to get their password and private keys — but first they’ll have to find that person’s offline identity, map it to a physical location, establish that they have jurisdiction, send in the (expensive) special forces, and do this to an endless number of people in an endless number of locations, while dealing with various complications likeanonymous remailers,multisigs,zero-knowledge,dead-man’s switches, andtimelocks. So at a minimum, encryption increases thecostof state coercion. In other words, seizing Bitcoin is not quite as easy asinflatinga fiat currency. It’s not something a hostile state like Venezuela can seize en masse with a keypress, they need to go house-by-house. The only real way around this scalability problem would be a cheap autonomous army of AI police drones, something China may ultimately be capable of, but that’d be expensive and we aren’t there yet.41 Until then, the history of Satoshi Nakamoto’s successful maintenance of pseudonymity, of Apple’spartial thwartingof the FBI, and of the Bitcoin network’s resilience to the Chinese state’smining shutdownshow that the Network’s pseudonymity and cryptography are alreadypartiallyobstructing at least some of the State’s surveillance and violence. Encryption thus limits governments in a way no legislation can. And as described at length inthis piece, it’s not just about protection of private property. It’s about using encryption and crypto to protect freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of contract, prevention from discriminationandcancellation via pseudonymity, individual privacy, and truly equal protection under rule-of-code — even as the State’s paper-based guarantees of the same become ever more hollow. Because the computer always gives the same output given the same input code, unlike the fallible human judiciary with its error-prone (or politicized) enforcement of the law. In this sense, the Network is the next Leviathan, because on key dimensions it is becoming more powerful and morejustthan the State. When we say that the Network is the next Leviathan, which we can abbreviate as “Network > State” it is useful to give specifics. Here are several concrete examples where the Network’s version of a given social practice is more powerful than the State’s version. These examples can be multiplied. As mentioned before, Uber and Lyft are better regulators than the State’s paper-based taxi medallions, email is superior to the USPS, and SpaceX is out-executing NASA. If you think about borders, you now need to think about the Network’s telepresence (which defeats physical borders) and its encryption (which erects digital borders). Or if you care about, say, the US census, the Network gives areal-time surveywhich is far more up to date than the State’s 10 year process. In short, if you can bring the Network to bear on an issue, it will often be the most powerful force. This is essentially what every startup founder does, all the time: they try to figure out the Network way of doing something, without going through the State. There’s an app for that! This is conceptually important, because a startup society founder that can reposition a particular conflict such that it is the Network against the State has a chance to win. But if they go through the legacy State, they’ll be an alligator out of water, and they will likely lose. Applying the “Network > State” formulation to recent events, think about January 2021, when — at the behest of the New York Times Company and all of mainstream media — Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter combined to deplatform a sitting president and disappear his supporters’ app from the internet. This was undeniable proof of the US government’s impotence, because the “most powerful man in the world” was clearly no longer even the most powerful man in his own country. The informal Network (the US establishment) trumped the formal State (the US government).42 Obviously, Trump and the Republicans weren’t in control of events. Less obviously, elected Democrats weren’t either. Oh, sure, many of them added their voices to the cacophony. But because the First Amendment constrains government capacity to restrain speech, they couldn’t tell the tech CEOs to shut down opposition voices - but the publishers could. And because the final control over these networks is in private hands, state officials didn’t have the final say. Put another way, the people with their fingers on the button are no longer elected officials of the state. Does the US governmentfeellike it is in charge? That is what Network > State means. To be clear, the Network does not wineveryconflict with the State. In many cases the actual outcome is “State > Network.” Indeed, the conflict between these two Leviathans will shape this century like the conflict between the God and State Leviathans shaped the last. Some examples of “State > Network” include Ross Ulbricht’s arrest by the US government, the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency, the European Union’s GDPR regulation, the COVID lockdowns that inhibited any digital nomad’s ability to exit, the rising number of government internet shutdowns, and the US establishment’s push to censor the internet. Let’s review a few cases of particular importance: the techxit from San Francisco, the political defeat of tech founders in China, the biasing of AI in the name of AI bias, and the digital deplatforming of establishment critics in both the West and East. SF city government > Bay Area tech founders.Despite how competent the tech founders of SF were on the Network, the political billionaires of the San Francisco city government managed to use their control of the State to turn the city into a hellhole. Intentionally or not, this had the effect of driving out the new money, their potential competition. Yes, there have been some successful tech-funded recall efforts recently, but it’s likely too little, too late. It’s akin to a stock price showing a bit of an upward trend after a huge and irreversible drop. Because the Bay Area’s monopoly is over. Technology has now globally decentralized into web3, and San Francisco (and even Silicon Valley) has now lost its position as the undisputed tech capital of the world. You no longerneedto go to the Bay Area to build a startup — you can found and fund from anywhere. This is, on balance, a good thing — the fact that tech is no longer highly dependent on the triple dysfunction of SF/CA/USA is crucial to the world’s future. Note also that while the defeat of tech in SF was due to State > Network, the reason tech lives to fight another day is thanks to remote work, which allowed movement away from SF in a “Techxit.” And remote work is a case of Network > State. CCP > Chinese tech founders.Until about 2018, Chinese tech founders were celebrated by the CCP. Imagine if Zuckerberg and Dorsey were given the equivalent of Senate seats for their contribution to the economy, brought into the establishment rather than standing at a remove, and you’ll get a sense of what the tone was like. Jack Ma (Alibaba founder), Pony Ma (Tencent founder), and their peers were either one of the 95 million CCP members (<7% of the country) or praised by CCP media. Then everything shifted. Just like America, China had its own establishment-driven techlash.43The huge cost of pausing of the massive ANT Financial IPO on some regulatory pretense was a signal. For the last several years, the CCP has put what it considers to be the “national interest” over enormous sums of money, incurring at least a trillion dollars in cost for COVID lockdowns, shutdowns of IPOs, and overnight bans of entire industries like gaming and Bitcoin mining. This looks stupid. Maybe it is stupid. Or maybe they know something we don’t. The CCP’s early action in the 2000s and 2010s to ban foreign social networks looks farsighted in retrospect, as if they hadn’t built their own Weibo and WeChat, then US executives in Silicon Valley would have been able to deplatform (or surveil) anyone from China with a keystroke. So, unfortunately, perhaps signaling that there are “more important things than money” and gearing for conflict will turn out to put the CCP in a better position for what comes. Be that as it may, the Chinese techlash is an example of “State > Network.” The CCP-controlled Chinese State beat the international Network of Chinese tech founders. But it didn’t win forever, as many of the most ambitious founders and funders in China are now using the Network tomove abroadand escape the Chinese State. Biasing AI with AI Bias.Jon Stokes has writtenat lengthabout “AI ethics” and I’d encourage you to read his work. But in brief, this entire pseudofield is about putting a thumb on the scale of AI algorithms in the name of balancing the scales, particularly at influential tech giants like Google. It’s about ensuring that members of the US establishment are always looking over the shoulder of technologists, making sure that their code is 100% regime compliant44, just as the Soviet Union did with its commissars, the NSDAP did withgleichschaltung, and Xi has done withXuexi Qiangguo.45 The fundamental concept is about asserting moral control over a technological field. AI “ethics” doesn’t really contest what is true or false, it contests what is good and bad. And what is bad? Anything that advances a politically unfavorable narrative. As a concrete example, in 2021, Ukraine was widely reported to be a corrupt country full ofAzov BattalionNazis. By mid 2022, those reports would have been reclassified as “disinformation” and pushed down to page 10 of the search results46, if the AI bias people had their way. Now, the usual dodge is that there’s always discretion involved in the selection of any machine learning training set, and judgment used in the configuration of any algorithm, so who is to say what “unbiased” means? But the goal here is to make sure that discretion does not scatter randomly, or at the discretion of the individual investigator, but instead consistently points in a single “ethically approved” direction, whether that be submission to NYT (in Blue America) or CCP (in China). It’s centralized political control by another name. Note also that the name of their field has been chosen to ward off attack. What, are you againstethicsin AI? (These are the same people who speak mockingly of “ethics in journalism” when it suits them.) So, a better term for it is “AI bias,” not as in thestudyof bias, but as in the study of how tobias AI. And the power the AI bias people have is enormous. A few zealots in the right places at big tech companies can and will distort the Google results of billions of people, until and unless Google’s monopoly is disrupted, or unless the right people within Google push to make their algorithms transparent.47Newspeak isn’t a dystopia for them, it’s an instruction manual. And they might well win. The episode whereMerriam-Webster changed the dictionary in real-time for political purposesis only the beginning; the new Google is about to use its power to centrally changethought. This is considerably worse than Baidu, which more straightforwardly filters searches that are “problematic” for the CCP. Because the AI bias people pretend that they are doing it for the powerless, when they are really doing it to maintain the US establishment’s power. Digital Deplatforming.Another example of the State trumping the Network, of political power exercised against technological truth, can be seen in the muzzling of regime-disfavored voices on social media. As always, this is obvious in China. Say something the CCP doesn’t like on Sina Weibo and yourpost disappears, and possibly youraccountand maybe you’re brought in for “tea” by the security forces. But in the West, if you say something the regime doesn’t like on Twitter, your post disappears, and possibly your account, and — in American protectorateslike the UK— maybe you’rebrought infor “tea” by the security forces. Ah, didn’t expect that, did you? But click those links. The only reason thatUK-style hate speech lawshaven’tyet come to the US is the First Amendment, which has also limited to some degree the totality of private attempts at speech and thought control. Nevertheless, even by 2019 we could see theconvergenceof the American and Chinese systems in this respect. Just as WeChat blocked mention of Tiananmen, Facebook blocked mention of an alleged whistleblower. Operationally, it’s thesame thing. In the East it’s official government censorship, whereas in the West it’s unofficial private censorship, but that’s not a substantive difference - it’s censorship as ordered by the Chinese and US establishments respectively. The substantive difference is that in the West there’s a third faction of decentralized censorship resistance. The point is that sometimes Network > State (which is new), and sometimes State > Network (which is what most people expect), and the competition between these Leviathans will define our time. But is it always competition, or could it also be co-optation? As Larry Ellison put it, “choose your competitors carefully, because you’ll become a lot like them.” This is a tech founder’s version of theHegelian dialectic, where thesis and antithesis mix to form a synthesis. In other words, when you have three Leviathans (God, State, Network) that keep struggling with each other, they won’t remain pure forms. You’ll see people remix them together to create new kinds of social orders, new hybrids, new syntheses in the Hegelian sense. We already mentioned the Chinese version of this fusion (“the backwards will be beaten”) in the context of political power vs technological truth, but it goes beyond just the determination of truth to how society itself is organized. For example: These are political examples of mixing Leviathans, but there are other ways of thinking about the concept. One important synthesis that deserves special mention is the “Network/God”: a Network God, an AI God, aGPT-9 orDALL·E10 that gives instant, superhuman answers to difficult questions using the knowledge of all of humanity. After all, people already do confide to Google as if it were God, or at least a confessions booth. In the 1980s there was a popular children’s book calledAre You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, and you can imagine an app version of this where people ask a given AI God for advice. That god need not be a general AI. It could encode a specific morality. It could be tuned and trained on particular corpora rather than the general web. What would Jesus do (WWJD), in an app? The ChineseXuexi Qiangguoapp could in fact be seen as an early version of this — “What would Xi Jinping do?” — though one could also have decentralized versions. What would Lee Kuan Yew do? What would David Ben-Gurion do? What would George Washington do? What would the people you respect advise in your situation? A language model trained on their corpora — on all the public text and audio they’ve emitted over their lives, which could amount to many millions of words — may achieve something like the sci-fi episode where people are revived by AI in an app. There’s already av1, it just needs to be augmented with a VR simulacrum. And even though this kind of thing is painted as negative in media likeHerandBlack Mirror, it’s really not obvious that getting interactive advice from Lee Kuan Yew’s app is worse than getting it from Lee Kuan Yew’s books. The study of God/State/Network syntheses brings us to the fusion we’re most interested in: a Network/State, of which one of them is our titular network state. And there are a few different ways to get to a Network/State fusion. The first is the from-scratch version described in chapter one, where an internet leader builds a large enough network union online that it can crowdfund territory and eventually attain diplomatic recognition. But it’s worth discussing other scenarios, where existing governments fuse with the network — both positive and negative Network/State syntheses. Start with the observation that companies, cities, currencies, communities, and countries are all becoming networks. As an analogy, we used to think of books, music, and movies as distinct. Then they all became represented by packets sent over the internet. Yes, we listened to music in audio players and viewed books in ebook readers, but their fundamental structure became digital. Similarly, today we think of stocks, bonds, gold, loans, and art as different. But all of them are represented as debits and credits on blockchains. Again, the fundamental structure became digital. Now, we are starting to think of different kinds of collections of people –— whether communities, cities, companies, or countries —– all fundamentally as networks, where the digital profiles and how they interact become more and more fundamental. This is obvious for communities and companies, which can already be fully remote and digital, but even already existing cities and countries are starting to be modeled this way, because (a) their citizens48are often geographically remote, (b) the concept of citizenship itself is becoming similar to digital single sign-on, (c) many 20th century functions of government have already been de-factotransferredto private networks like (electronic) mail delivery, hotel, and taxi regulation, (d) cities and countries increasingly recruit citizens online, (e) so-called smart cities are increasingly administrated through a computer interface, and (f) as countries issue central bank digital currencies and cities likely follow suit, every polity will be publicly traded on the internet just like companies and coins. And that’s just for pre-existing polities which retrofit themselves with aspects of the network. It doesn’t include the most fundamental network property of thede novonetwork states described herein: namely that the citizenryitselffirst assembles in the cloud and only then crowdfunds the earth. Examples of pre-existing states integrating with the network include (a) El Salvador’s integration with the Bitcoin network, (b) Wyoming’sdecentralized autonomous organization (DAO) lawand Norway’scap table bill, which are integrations with the Ethereum network, and (c) places like Estonia and Singapore, where every government workflow is already online. In each of these cases, cities and states are fusing with networks to ship new services that are useful to citizens. This is the benign version of the Network/State fusion, the one people will flock to. The malign version of the Network/State fusion is what happened in China, and is happening in America at the federal level with the tech crackdowns. In both the Chinese and American cases the State is “acquiring” centralized technology companies at gunpoint, fusing with the Network from above. In China the recipe was (a) a few years of media demonization plus (b) mandatoryXi Jinping Thoughtsessions followed by (c) decapitation and quasi-nationalization –— as is happening withAlibabaandByteDance. In America during the techlash it was very similar: (a) several years of media demonization plus (b) quasi-mandatory wokeness within followed by (c) anti-trust, regulation, and quasi-nationalization. Sometimes the decapitation is forceful (Uber was an early target here) and sometimes it’s quasi-voluntary. Indeed, one thesis on why many of the major tech founders have stepped down as of mid-2022, other than Zuck, is that they don’t want to become personally demonized during the no-win antitrust process. It’s more explicit in China that this wasn’t a choice — Jack Ma is no longer in control of the company he founded, and many other Chinese founders have been similarly relieved of their duties. In other words, both the Chinese and American establishments have invented rationales to essentiallyseizepreviously founder-controlled companies.49 That is, whatever the surface justification, these are hostile takeovers of centralized tech companies by centralized states. Once taken over, these companies will be turned into total surveillance machines and tools of social control. In China, this is already obvious. But in America,anti-trust may mean zero trust. To be clear, this is partially a forecast for the future, and perhaps it can be averted, but in the aftermath of any ostensibly “economic” settlement the US national security state could get everything it ever wanted in terms of backdoors to Google and Facebook. The NSA won’t need tohackits way in, it’ll get a front door. And then it will likely gethacked in turn, spraying all of your data over the internet. This is the malign version of the Network/State fusion, the one people want to exit from. Can we put all three Leviathans together in the modern era? Is there something that’d fit? Yes. The benign version of the network/state synthesis we’ve just described offers greater administrative efficiency, greater economic returns, and greater levels of citizen consent. But it doesn’t yet offer greaterpurpose, or meaning. As a preview, that’s where theOne Commandmentcomes in. The concept is that you don’t want or need to start an entirely new religion to build a startup society, but youdoneed a moral innovation of some kind. If all you have to offer is a higher standard of living, people may come as consumers, but they won’t come for the right reasons. The consumer-citizen is coming to enjoy a great society, not to sacrifice to make a society great. They won’t understand thevaluesthat underpin your startup society’s valuation. And you likely won’t be able tobuildthat high valuation or higher standard of living without a higher purpose, just as neither Apple nor America itself was initially built for money alone. You want to recruit producers, not consumers, and for that, you’ll need a purpose. That higher purpose could be a traditional religion, as in Rod Dreher’sBenedict Option, but it could also be a doctrine with a deeply thought through “One Commandment,” a moral innovation that inverts one of society’s core assumptions while keeping all others intact. For example, taking the seemingly trivial moral premise that “sugar is bad” and seriously carrying it through to build a Keto Kosher society involves a focused yet all-encompassing change to every restaurant, grocery store, and meal within a jurisdiction. We give more exampleslater. The concept of three Leviathans explains why a network state is now feasible. The Network is a new sheriff in town, a new Leviathan, a new force that is more powerful than the State in many contexts. That has changed the balance of power. While synthesesarearising, so are conflicts between Network and State. And that explains much of today’s instability: when Leviathans wrestle, when Godzilla fights King Kong, the earth trembles.

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. We’ve talked about the history of power, of God, State, and Network. Now let’s talk about the recent history of power struggles, between people of God, people of the State, and people of the Network. Stereotypically, the people of God offer50thoughts and prayers, the people of the State say “there oughta be a law!”, and the people of the Network write some code. The differences go very deep. It’s a difference in first steps and in ultimate loyalties. Once you understand whether someone prioritizes the God, State, or Network Leviathan you understand what tactics they’ll prefer, what values they hold, and where they’re coming from. To illustrate this, let’s apply the lens of Leviathans to analyze (a) the internal divisionswithinAmerica’s conservative reds and progressive blues, (b) the conflictbetweenglobal technology and the US establishment, and (c) the mental model of the base-raters loyal to the US establishment. As we’ll see, the introduction of the Network Leviathan clarifies some conflicts and splits some factions. The whole world tunes in daily to watch the endless American digital civil war on Twitter. (“I feel bad for our country. But this is tremendous content.”) Countless words have been written about this topic. But the lens of the Leviathans offers a new perspective on these warring tribes, on the conservative reds, progressive blues, and libertarianish graysnamedby Scott Alexander. The gray tribe is the easiest to analyze. It is fair to say that they are primarily people of the Network Leviathan. These technological progressives are not just atheists, they are alsoastatists, as they do not typically believe in either God or the State. They are genuinely internationalists in a way neither red nationalists nor blue faux51internationalists are, as they don’t subscribe to American exceptionalism, and interact with people from other countries through the Network as equals. The blues and the reds are more complex, however. It’snotas simple as “Blue equals State” and “Red equals non-State.” Not at all. A significant fraction of blues has now gone to the Network; these are the left-libertarians, the web3 socialists. And a good chunk of reds will remain loyal to the State; let’s call them secular nationalists. So if and when things line up as Network vs State, if there’s a highly inflationary event that pits the orange Bitcoin against the green Dollar, we may see an acceleration of the ongoing realignment. Many blues will line up with grays and reds on the side of the international Network, and many reds will side with blues to defend the centralized American State. Let’s explain. Each member of blue tribe will have to make a choice in the years to come: are they loyal to neutral decentralized networks that treat both Americans and non-Americans equally, or are they actually just loyal to the US establishment — essentially nationalists in disguise? Is their definition of “democracy” commensurate with a world where the 4% (namely the Americans) rule the 96% (namely the non-Americans), inflating away the globe’s savings, destroying local cultures, and surveilling the world at all times? Or do they believe the rest of the world deserves digital self-determination? In short, will the internationally-minded liberal choose the decentralized Network or the centralized State? To understand this choice, let’s orient ourselves. The blue tribe is the most powerful in Western society today, and has two52main internal factions: the left-authoritarians who worship the State, and the left-libertarians who are (unconsciously) people of the Network.53 Before we begin, we need to understand that the blue belief system of “Wokeness” isn’t exactly a religion. It’s a doctrine, and it includes both people of the State and the Network. That is, while it’s become popular to talk about Wokeness as a religion, and while thereissomething to this, it’s more precise to talk about it as adoctrine: namely, “a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group.” The concept of a doctrine encompasses religiousandpolitical beliefs, both God- and State-worship. And nowadays the “other group” could be a Network entity of some kind, like a social network or cryptocurrency. So now we have an umbrella term: doctrine. God-worshippers have religions (religious doctrines), State-loyalists have political parties (with political doctrines), and Network-centrists have social networks or cryptocurrencies (with tightly enforced content moderation or crypto tribalism respectively, which are network doctrines). Each doctrine has a Leviathan, a most powerful force. And a religion is then just a type of doctrine. With this definition, we can return to the question: is capital-W Wokeness, likeCommunismandNazismbefore it, a religion that evolved to jump over the formal principle of church/state separation by posing as a non-religion? Well, as several have now observed, Wokenessdoeshave cognates to many aspects of Christianity — we all have the Calvinist original sin of bigotry, we’re going to the warm hell of climate change unless we repent, unbelievers must “recant,”heresy must be suppressed, the West’s beliefs must be evangelized at gunpoint, and so on. See Curtis Yarvin’sHow Dawkins Got Pwned, John McWhorter’sWoke Racism, Andrew Sullivan onAmerica’s New Religions, Noah Smith onWokeness as Old-Time Religion, Tom Holland’s concluding chapter inDominion, Paul Graham onHeresy, and Michael Shellenberger and Peter Boghossian’sdetailed infographicfor perspectives on this topic. But while it’s directionally accurate, calling wokeness a religion doesn’tquitefit because the wokes have a different theory of the prime mover. Wokeness is better termed a doctrine, because it’s actually crucial to note that wokes donotworship God; instead, one faction of wokes worships the State and the other is, less consciously, people of the Network. These internal denominational splits are defined by choice of Leviathan. And they’ll be important in the escalating conflict between State and Network, between Dollar and Bitcoin, between establishment journalists and decentralized media, between the American government and the global internet, as these divisions promise to split blue team in two. For the left-authoritarians among the blues, their primary Leviathan is the State, which is very real and can do violence against its/their enemies, as opposed to what they think of as an imaginary God. This is why State-worshippers mock the concept of “thoughts and prayers” in favor of “passing a law.” The State exists, after all, and can organize people to apply coercive force. But God’s vehicle, the church, no longer has enough belief behind it (in the West at least) to do the same. This is also why left-authoritarians tend to take for granted that all ills can be solved by “praying for relief” to the State, by forming some agency, by appropriating ever more money. Taxes are secular tithes, and the Gov-fearing man is like the God-fearing man — you simply cannot pay enough money and respect to the state, because as the DNC video says outright, “government is the one thing we all belong to.” It’s not about results, it’s about fealty. Even though they culturally love the State and hate the Network, it’s important to note that the left-authoritarians in the UShavemanaged to recently take control of big chunks of the Network, through placing sympathizers in key positions at Big Tech companies during the techlash andGreat Awokeningof the 2010s. (There are incipient signs of pushback here, though, at places like Netflix and even Google, where the very wokest are being terminated.) What do left-authoritarians generally look like from an occupational standpoint? The body of left-authoritarians are theNPCspaying the NYT monthly subscriptions for the official “truth,” slavishly turning their heads with every new software update, insisting thatmasks don’t workbeforethey do, reliably surging behind the current thing. These are just foot soldiers, but interestingly the most important left-authoritarians aren’t the elected officials. As Yarvin in particular hasdocumented at length, the most important left-authoritarians are not formally part of the elected State at all. They are the professors, activists, bureaucrats, and journalists. The key concept is that much of America’s control circuitry has evolved to live outside the formal state, thereby making it resistant to displacement by democratic election. They laud “democracy” but avoid it in practice, throughdual classstock, tenure for theirbureaucratsandprofessors, tax-exempt compounding for theirfoundations, andideologicalpurificationof theirorganizations. As with the communists who endlessly burbled about their “democratic people’s republics” while eschewingelections, the left-authoritarians don’t actually subject their control of key institutions to a vote.54 There are different names for this left-authoritarian network that controls the state from outside by “holding it accountable.” We can call it thePaper Belt(which emphasizes their Rust-Belt-like technological backwardness), we can call it the Cathedral (which emphasizes their holiness), we can call it the regime (which emphasizes their illegitimacy), or we can call it simply the American establishment (which emphasizes their enduring power). Later we will call itNYT/USD, to emphasize their source of truth and digital economy relative to BTC/web3 and CCP/RMB. It’s important to understand that the power of the left-authoritarians comes from getting the officials of the centralized American State and (more recently) the executives of the centralized Big Tech Network to crush their enemies. The main technique is to “manipulate procedural outcomes”, often by getting something true to be officially deemed disinformation (as in the example of the pre-2020 electionlaptop story), or conversely getting something false to be deemed official truth (as in the case of theCambridge Analytica story). The left-authoritarians are the main proponents of thepolitical powertheory of truth, as “truth” is whatever they find helpful to move political power into action. When an employee of a media corporation talks about an article having “impact,” for example, they mean impact in the sense of a government truncheon impacting your head, via a new rule or regulation. Go read thedescriptionsof the prizes they award to each other, and you’ll see them celebrate themselves for making something that was previously volitional newly mandatory or forbidden. “Our report led to government action!” Whether that action was thebombing of Libyaor thebanning of plastic strawsmakes no nevermind; impact is impact. Laws aren’t the only form of impact. Getting someone fired is too. We talk of hit pieces and cancel culture as if they’re aberrations, but they’re actually the core of left-authoritarian culture. Recall that the most prestigious thing any establishment journalist ever did was Watergate: namely, getting a president fired while selling millions of copies of their newspaper. This episode has been endlessly romanticized, but here’s a different perspective on it: the corporate takeover of America we’re supposed to be constantly vigilant for actuallyalready occured50 years ago, just from the left, when a few privately-owned media corporations cooperated to get Nixon fired and the Pentagon Papers leaked, proving that the control circuitryoutsidethe State was upstream of the mere elected government and US military. Now, wasWatergatea crime? Sure, but worse thanthe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution? Worse than theNasiriyah testimony? Worse thanWMD? Worse than the lies used to drive America’s many wars? And, relevantly, worse than what JFK did toget elected? After all, contra his protestations, Nixon may well have been a crook, but asSeymour Hersh has convincingly reported, so was John F. Kennedy — yet the exposure ofhisWatergate-level election shenanigans somehow waited till thirty years after he ascended to the presidency over one Richard Milhous Nixon. Anyway, the problem isn’t just the asymmetry of the “accountability” — that’s not really about hypocrisy, but hierarchy. The problem with America’s left-authoritarians is also that they’ve built a terrible culture. A society that puts Watergate on a pedestal is just fundamentally different from one that puts NASA (or SpaceX) on a pedestal. Because if what’s applauded is putting a man out of work, rather than putting a man on the moon, there will be a lot of cancellation and not a lot of creation. Firing someone should be a necessary evil, not the highest good. We linger on Watergate because it was the moment when the left-authoritarian American Network outside the State became unambiguously ascendant. It was the public demonstration of a very different model from the left-authoritarian Soviets. The Soviets had a state-controlled press, but America now had apress-controlled state. After Watergate, the left-authoritarians knew that they were the boss of the boss, that they could get the president fired, that they could “hold someone accountable” — and, conversely, that no one could really holdthemaccountable in any way. For example, what was the punishment for printing the “disinformation” that led to, say, the Iraq War, or the Holodomor? Suspension from social media? Reparations for the dead? Or nothing? Much easier to pin it all on a single Nixon, or even a Stalin for that matter, than a decentralized mass of nameless left-authoritarians.55 Two additional points before we move on from our God/State/Network-informed analysis of the left-authoritarians. First, more recently, as American state capacity has declined, the left-authoritarians have shifted their targets to the new authorities: the CEOs of tech companies in particular. They realize on some level that (a)Network > Statein many contexts and furthermore that (b) the Network-aided global ascent of tech founders and populist leaders could reduce their control over the State, so they have chosen to (c) strike first by gaining control of those tech companies that have achieved state-like scale. Theirmodus operandiwas much the same as it is for influencing the State: use reporting to harass tech executives into firing people that left-authoritarians don’t like, then push them to enact policies that left-authoritariansdolike — such as “content moderation” over any message other than that emanating from approved establishment outlets. The left-authoritarians have even admitted to this in unguarded moments; see for examplethis charactertalking about how “journalism is about raw power” orthis admissionthat the media’s explicit goal was to use the State as a billy club against the Network for fun and profit. Second, an important insight is that behind many of these left-authoritarian journalists (and activists and nonprofits) is an old-money zillionaire, a nepotistic heir of some kind. You won’t find someone at The Atlantic criticizing Laurene Powell Jobs, you won’t find someone atNPRgoing after Soros, and you won’t find someone at The New York Times Company that even publiclyadmitsthat their boss, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, is a rich white male nepotist. This puts their behavior into stark relief: the left-authoritarian wants to get you fired, or get your boss to fire you, but won’t evenmentiontheir boss. They are fundamentally just dogs on a leash, hit men for old money, assassins for the establishment. There is a split among blue Americans. Some of them, the left-libertarians, are actually best modeled as people of the Network — meaning, the social network. They truly aren’t primarily loyal to the Democrat party or even the institutions that are upstream of it, but to their community online — which increasingly diverges from the party line. These are the deplatformed sex workers, the ones engaging in risky public activism rather than the ones merely funding it, the anarchists, the journalists so consistent in their beliefs that they’re actually striking against their nepotistic owners, and the ethical anti-imperialists. They reallydon’tidentify with the US establishment that much, even if they sometimes wish it would execute the redistribution strategy of their dreams. Their primary people are the others in their social network. And that Network is becoming their new Leviathan. For the professional protester, for example, they can use the offline tactics fromBeautiful TroubleorRoots to Powerto laboriously organize an in-person procession outside a government office…or they can do the same thing online by simply posting a hashtag and materializing a digital crowd, then going direct with their cause rather than negotiating with an establishment journalist for exposure. So what’s giving them more leverage these days: the institutions that surround the legacy State, or the features of the decentralized Network? Another factor pushing left-libertarians away from the US establishment is the strong left-authoritarian shift towards holiness over coolness. Fredrik DeBoer actuallydiscussedthis shift while it was underway, while society was still transitioning from the old-time religion of Judeo-Christianity to the new doctrine of wokeness: Silicon Valley types, by contrast, believe in things…Tangible values about progress and culture. The Californian ideology plus the blockchain or whatever. There’s content there… The media has none of that. The old school media values of truth telling and muckraking have long since been abandoned by the media itself, as real values require sincerity and media culture abhors sincerity. You can’t sit on Twitter all day telling shitty jokes about how nothing matters and then turn around and say “but also we’re the guardians of truth and democracy.” If Silicon Valley has captured the value of media for shareholders and is slowly strangling the industry to death, righting the course will require people within media who are willing to stand up and say, “Here are my values. They are what they are. I embody them without irony and thus I am vulnerable. If you value these things too you have to fight to save our industry.” Such a position would require a willingness to leave blank sarcasm aside and to start writing again for the world instead of only writing to appear clever to other writers. Can the media make this kind of move? I don’t see how they can; the social capture of the entire industry is just far too acute. As smart as this post was, things didn’t work out quite as DeBoer expected. The push toward sincerity — towards filling that God-shaped hole — ended up cleaving the blues in two. That is, contra DeBoer’s forecast (“I don’t see how they can”), some of the earnest blues actuallydiddeclare themselves champions of “moral clarity”, and have now gone over purely to unironic State-worship, to applauding multi-day prayer vigils with Liz Cheney for the wrongs visited upon their sacred Capitol. AsGlenn Greenwaldhas written about at length, there’s no daylight anymore between the Democrats and the Department of Defense, no criticism of the Central Intelligence Agency by CNN. This fusion wasn’t the full communism that DeBoer sometimes claims to prefer, but it was a fulsome declaration of values by the media56nevertheless. It’s the culmination of the trend towards devout wokeness that Scott Alexander identified years ago in “Gay Rites are Civil Rites.” The left-authoritarians have done to wokeness in a few years what Nietzschenotedhad been done to Christianity over the span of eons: namely, they’ve transformed it from a revolutionary ideology into a ruling-class ideology. But every action has a reaction, every activity spawns a Soros-like reflexivity, and Scott Alexander was actually ahead of the curve again here as well. Before “Gay Rites are Civil Rites”, he also identified a second dynamic of relevance, the trendawayfrom devout wokeness that he described in “Right is the new Left.” And this brings us to back to the left-libertarians. The kind of blue that listens toGray Zone,Red Scare, orJimmy Doreis repelled by State worship. They don’twantto choose something as down the middle as pledging allegiance to the American flag and the national security state for which it stands. They actually believed the things they said against the establishment, and don’t endorse it simply because it’s ostensibly “their” team now wearing the NSA headsets. The left-libertarian subgroup of blues has begun to flirt with decentralized media and web3, because they’re realizing the Network could be more interesting than the declining American State. Could Substack be more remunerative than Sulzberger? Could Satoshi’s community deliver more for them than Bernie’s? If they need to redefine all that as “socialism,” so be it! And if their funding stream is changing, their ideology is slowly shifting too. Yes, they may havestartedas mere pawns of America’s left-authoritarian establishment, but what they value is increasingly coming from the decentralized global Network rather than the centralized American State. So they are beginning to uncouple. And that’s the emerging Network-vs-State division within blue tribe. Each member of red tribe, the conservatives, will also have to make a choice in the years to come: do they believe in the founding principles encoded in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, or will they simply enforce whatever edicts emanate from an increasingly malign US establishment — supporting statists in practice? Is their definition of “America” commensurate with a world where the US federal government is itself the most determined opponent of liberty, inflating away their savings, deconstructing conservative America’s culture, and surveilling them at all times? Or do they believe American cities and states deserve digital self-determination? In short, will the American conservative choose the centralized State or the decentralized Network? Or will they somehow stay neutral amidst all that, keeping God alone uppermost? This will eventually be a conscious choice. Right now, it’s an unconscious three-way split. The three-legged stool of Reaganism — the religious conservatives, the secular nationalists, and the internationalist capitalists — side with the God, State, and Network Leviathans respectively. These are theirprimaryidentities, because they correspond to that thing which they think of as the most powerful force in the world: almighty God, the US military, or (implicitly) the global network of trade and communication that will soon simply be identified with cryptocurrency. During the Cold War, religious conservatives believed in an almighty God, unlike the “godless communists” they fought against. Today, the people of God among the reds have sharply reduced numbers, but their moral compass remains the man on high. Insofar as there is a religious revival, it may be driven by theOne Commandment-based startup societies we describe later on. SeeRod Dreher on the Protestants, Adrian Vermeule andSohrab Ahmari on the Catholics, and Tablet’sBig Tentto get a sense of their views. The people of the State among the reds are more prominent. These are the secular nationalists, the national security hawks, the people who may not like the left-authoritarians but who will nevertheless reflexively support the US in every foreign intervention. They may agree that the US is trending in a bad direction, but they think China is far worse. As such, they’re still building drones, coding surveillance, and cheering videos likethis onewhere the US admits to fomenting thecolor revolutionsthat are often otherwisedenied. I’m somewhat sympathetic to this group — after all, they aren’tburningtheir own countrydown! — but unfortunately, on foreign policy they are helping to burn downotherpeople’s countries, and often for no good reason. The issue is that in the absence of a compelling alternative, or an undeniable collapse, you’re simply not going to convince a secular nationalist that America and China arebothbecoming digital totalitarian states, or that a US establishment that has pushed half a dozen countries intomurderouschaosisn’t quite the moral exemplar that they think it is. The reason isbecausethe red statist is a secular nationalist: they don’t have a God, but they do believe in the State, the good vision of America as a shining city on a hill. It really doesn’t matter if this doesn’t exist — it’s the USA from their youth and from their movies. It’sTop GunAmerica, and they’ll keep paying to watch the inspiring remakes, not the depressing footage of what the US military actually did inIraq,Libya,Afghanistan, andSyria. There’s both a laudable aspect to this kind of loyalty, and a frustrating one. These folks are like the Soviet soldiers that dutifully served in Afghanistan. You might argue they’re fighting for a cause that is at best pointless and at worstevil, and that they’ll only come home to find their shelves empty and their culture crushed…but you have to acknowledge they’re risking their lives regardless. Fundamentally, the red secular nationalist often understands how bad the US establishment is at home, but doesn’t want to hear about the needless destruction wreaked by the US military abroad. In this they have the opposite set of blind spots from the blue left-libertarian, who can clearly see the ruin of countries unfortunate enough to experience a 21st century US “intervention,” yet imagines the same government that’s a chaotic destroyer abroad can become a benevolent redistributor at home. In other words, while the red secular nationalist maintains an implicit Hollywood-movie-style belief in a US military that can beat up anyone, the blue left-libertarian persists in their belief that the State’s civilian governmentcouldfix anything at home if only enough people willed it. Using the lens of the Leviathans, these are both clearly ways the State becomes a stand-in for God, in its terrible Father and benevolent Mother forms respectively. Let’s digress and engage the China point for a second, as it’s the go-to argument of the red secular nationalist. To paraphrase, the red nationalist often concedes that US military intervention abroad has been regrettable, but CCP dominance would be so much worse that we need the US military to not just stick around but to expand and grow stronger. The short counterargument is that it may instead be best for countries to rearm, and take on their own defense – rather than having an increasingly chaotic US try to fight a Second Cold War on others’ behalf in the middle of an internal Cold Civil War and what might become a Second Great Depression. That is, we get there by a different route, but we arrive at much the same conclusion as an isolationist rightist or an anti-imperialist leftist. Whether you think America is too good for the world, or whether you think it’s an ill effect on countries abroad, or some complex combination of both, we may want (and observe) US military withdrawal and regional rearmament rather than a Second Cold War. What’s the long-form version of the argument? Start with the observation that the CCPismore oppressive at home than the US establishment, but it’s also empirically less destructive abroad. Why? Not because of benevolence, but because the CCP is checked by the US military abroad. Thus China is focused on building up Africa while America is blowing up the Middle East. Yes, you can argue the Chinese are building colonies in Africa…but they’re functional colonies, with new roads and ports to carry raw materials, unlike the blasted hellscapes left by US military intervention in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the like. With that said, we should have no illusions: China’s neighbors in Southeast Asia know the dragon would throw its weight around without a US military presence. Right now it can’t, because China is boxed in by the US military. Conversely, at home the CCP has no organized domestic political opposition, so it can be absolutely ruthless. The US establishment has the opposite set of constraints: unlike China, it doesn’t face organized military opposition abroad, so it’s highly incautious in its foreign policy. But also unlike the CCP itdoesface organized domestic political opposition at home, so it can’t be as ruthless domestically as itwantsto be. Let’s drill into the domestic point first, and then the military point. It’s really crucial to understand that the US establishment isnotmore ethical than the CCP when it comes to civil liberties. It’s just less competent! After all, the US establishment also doeswarrantless surveillancevia the NSA, unconstitutionalsearch and seizurevia the TSA, arbitrary confiscationofpropertyviacivil forfeiture, and so on. And that’s just what’s already been rolled out — the ambitions of the US establishment are just as totalitarian as the Chinese state’s, as we can see from its partially failed attempts atdisinformation agencies,civilian disarmament,digital censorship, and the like. Up to this point, these pushes have not been thwarted by the “ethics” of the US establishment, but by some combination of political opposition, Constitutional constraint, and bureaucratic incompetence. They keep trying, though. The US establishment isn’t organized enough to coordinate all the pieces, but unfortunately the recently captured Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoftarecapable of that level of coordination, as we saw during the Parler deplatforming, and theTiananmen-like censorshipof the “whistleblower.” So we’ll see what happens. Now on the military point. During the Cold War, the Soviet constraint meant the US was more cautious in its interventions, and actually generally achieved far better results. South Korea was better off than North Korea, West Germany was better off than East Germany, and Taiwan was better off than Maoist China. Even given all the lies on all sides around Vietnam, had the US won in South Vietnam, it’s quite possible that would have been a South Korea too; but because it lost, countless people had to flee and communism claimed many lives in Southeast Asia. After the Cold War ended, however, the US military became a hyperpower - and gradually evolved into a global fomenter of chaos rather than the generally conservative guardian of stability it was before 1991. The Iraq War can be seen as a transition point, as canSamantha Power’s R2P doctrinethat left Syria in ruins. By 2022, the question of whether America produces chaos with its military interventions can hardly be gainsaid — even the most committed American nationalist is hard pressed to name a country that’sbetteroff after arecentUS military intervention, something that wasn’t that hard to do from 1945-1991.57 OK, so let’s put it all together. Thereistruth to the idea that the US military is checking China, and that China would act more aggressively in the absence of the US military…but it’s true in the same way the Soviet military was once checking the US, and then the US military acted more aggressively in the absence of the Soviet military. That is, it’s true that the Soviet military was on balancenota force for good during 1945-1991, but it’s also true that the US military has on balancenotbeen a force for good during 1991-2021. It’s complicated. Even if their military did in some sense restrain the US from randomly blowing up the Middle East, it’s tough to argue that you’d still want the Soviet Union to still be around to limit US military intervention. Similarly, it’s hard to contend that the price of constraining China’s lawful evil ambitions in East Asia should be tolerance for America’s chaotic evil interventions in the Middle East, that defending against a potential Chinese drone armada should mean acceptance of endless destabilization by the US military. Ideally there’s a third way, a better choice - and that third way may simply bedecentralized defense, where countries like Japan and Germany re-arm, rather than outsourcing everything to the US or folding to China. This has its own issues, of course — but if we’re moving back into the 1800s and 1700s, as per the Future is Our Past thesis, limited wars betweengold-limitedgreat powers are arguably preferable to gigantic global conflicts between unlimited superpowers. In short: the secular American nationalist has an option that doesn’t involve either capitulating to China or pretending the US military is currently achieving fruitful things abroad. That third way is to support regional rearmament rather than fighting everyone else’s wars on their behalf. Getting back to our original topic, the third group within red tribe are the internationalist capitalists. We identify them as people of the Network. This is arguably something of aretcon, because the internet as we currently know it was barely a factor during the Cold War.58However, this subgroup involved the folks in favor of commerce and trade networks, both within and across borders — the capitalists. Today, that kind of capitalism is almost synonymous with internet startups and technology. The most valuable companies in the world were born on the Network. And the future of network capitalism is crypto-capitalism, because it’s not just transactions that can be represented on-chain — it’s entire financial statements, and companies themselves, and eventually the entire economy. The rise of Bitcoin means red people of the Network have a very specific way to think about their Leviathan, something distinct from both God and the State. Because BTC cannot be seized with one click by either the US or Chinese governments, it’s a symbol of international freedom and prosperity that is more powerful than any State. On balance, I’m sympathetic to this group as well, but it has its own internal issues. For one thing, Bitcoin Maximalism in particular is similar to Woke Capital in its fundamentalism. The main difference is that maximalism is zealous mononumism (devotion to a single coin) rather than monotheism (a single god) or monostatism (a single state). The Network doesn’t make the fanatical aspect of humanity vanish; it just moves it from God or the State to the Network. We now see that the God, State, and Network Leviathans all have their supporters within the conservative movement. An interesting point is that secular nationalists, being dispositionally conservative, can often stick with a symbol long after its substance has changed. Think about the many “Russian nationalists” who stuck with the Soviet Union even when it was a complete inversion of what had existed prior to 1917. Then compare this US Armyad from 2008with this recentad from 2021. So, in the event of any conflict between the Network and the State, such as a possible struggle between the inflating dollar and the deflationary Bitcoin, the right-statists could take the side of the national flag while the right-capitalists take the side of the digital currency. That is, if and when it’s clear that the continuation of American empire depends on the ability to continually inflate, the people of the State may side with the legacy state, and the people of the Network will side with the decentralized network.59So, that’s the Network-vs-State division within red tribe. If we add up all these pieces, we get a possible future where the left- and right-libertarians from both parties line up against the left- and right-authoritarians. We’re already starting to see this if we look at Substack vs establishment journalists, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald vs Fox News/NYT, BTC vs USD, web3 vs Big Tech, the migration of ethnic minorities to the Republicans and the migration of neoconservatives to the Democrats. People have talked about zombie Reaganism, but in this scenario a new coalition would be finally popping into view. And it’s a totally different carving of the political spectrum than the Reagan era. Rather than nationalists and capitalists (the right) against internationalists and socialists (the left), it’s internationalists and capitalists (left- and right-libertarians) against socialists and nationalists (left- and right-authoritarians).60 That Realignment would be the Network against the State. The authoritarians would outnumber the libertarians domestically, and have the institutions on their side. But the libertarians would have stronger individual talent, as they’d draw the iconoclasts, and they’d also draw support from the rest of the world. Let’s switch gears here and apply the lens of the Leviathans to a different conflict. Why are global technology and the US establishment at odds? Economics.You can say it’s because technology disrupted everything from Madison Avenue to Hollywood, as arguedhere. Looking at just the 80% drop in US media revenue alone from 2008 to 2012, it’s hard to believe that wasn’t a factor. Geography.You could note that the pre-2020 center of technology was Silicon Valley, which is 3000 miles away from the Bos-Wash corridor that houses the US establishment. Demographics.You can claim it’s becausetechis largelyimmigrantand the US establishment is 20-30 pointswhiter. Certainly by the high evidentiary standards of America’s leading disparate impact analysts and critical race theorists, this fact alone is prima facie evidence that the US establishment is institutionally racist towards their tech disruptors. Psychology.You can contend it’s due to a psychological difference between technical/financial types vs social/political elites, between people who focus on what is true versus those who care about what is popular. This relates to thedistinctionbetween technical and political truths. Metabolism.You might observe that the rivalry is particularly pronounced between US tech and media. The other arms of the US establishment, like academia, Hollywood, and government all needed multi-year cycles to ship anything, while only the news media had the 24/7 metabolism to match tech’s DNA. So they became the point of the spear for the US establishment’s counterattack. This is also why tech favors newsletters, podcasts, slide decks, and other types of fast-turnaround content that the establishment doesn’t natively specialize in. Bifurcation.You can remark that there’s a deep structural similarity between a socialist professor and technologist founder: both feel like they should be in charge. That’s why tech is a cultural fork of the US establishment, just as the US itself was a fork of the British Empire. It’s the same root, different branches. The ambitious intellectual who would in a previous life have become an academic theorist, jurist, or journalist is now a founder, engineer, or investor.61Because there’s a common thread between media and tech, which is the handling and presentation of information. Computer science took it one step further: it collapsed the distinction between the word and the deed, and turned a generation of intellectuals into software CEOs. Many people who previously thought they’d just advocate for a law to be passed and not worry about the details found out how hard it was to build things, to manage people, to turn a profit, to be the one in the arena. They became people of the Network. And then they came into conflict with those who remained people of the State. All of these are factors. But the last one probably gets to the root of the issue, because fundamentally, tech-vs-media is a clash of Leviathans. After all, the immigrant technologist movesbetweencountries while keeping their technical skills and network connections. For them, the Network provides their primary community, while the State is secondary. Conversely, the American establishmentarian gains their power from the State. It is all about passing a law or influencing a policymaker. And if the Network interferes with this process, perhaps by giving peopleaccesstoinformationthat undermines the State? Thenso muchfor the Network. Tech-vs-media is then best understood as a collision of fundamental values, between the people of the Network and the people of the State. You can think of the “people of the Network” as technological progressives, and the “people of the State” as political progressives (charitably) or technological conservatives (perhaps more realistically). Both are seemingly aligned at a high level on the goal of solving problems like controlling COVID-19, building housing, or reducing car crashes. But the people of the Network usually start by writing code and thinking about individual volition, whereas for the people of the State the first recourse is passing laws and collective coercion. Put another way, the people of the Network start by thinking about getting apiece of the networkto call their own. A domain name, something they can build up from scratch, starting with a bare website like reddit.com and ending up with a massive online destination that everyone voluntarily seeks out. The primary goal of the technological progressive, the tech founder is to build — and for no one to have power over them. By contrast the people of the State start by thinking about capturing apiece of the state. To win an election, to influence legislation via a nonprofit, to write an article that has “impact” in the sense of impacting policy, to be appointed Undersecretary of something or other…this is their mindset. The goal is to get a piece of this gigantic baton that is the government, to get a club to coerce people (for their own good of course), to maybe get a little budget along the way, and to finally “change the world” by changing the policy. To make something that was previously discretionary either mandatory or forbidden, to redirect the flow of printed money, to exert force through the law. The primary goal of the political progressive is thus the opposite of the technological progressive: their goal, verbalized or not, conscious or not, is to exert power overothers. Now, this is a caricature. Of course there are good people of the State, just like there are bad people of the Network. It is possible to use a minimal amount of coercion for good against genuinely bad actors; this truth is the difference betweenminarchismand anarchism. But obviously, these worldviews collide. One group wants no one to have power over them, while the other seeks to exert power over others. As a possible future scenario, one way this could be resolved is if the people of the State use the law to smash American tech over the 2020s, thereby gaining more power domestically. But tech has already gone global thanks to remote work, and most technologists are immigrants already…so the people of the Network may simply shift their attention overseas — ornot comein the first place. So the federal action would merely drives away immigrant founders, and the American State would lose power on a global scale. (Local and state governments in the US mayrespond differently, which is an intriguing twist). The same thing is also happening inChina, by the way, where many of the most able technologists are now alighting for new countries — andno longer comingto the US, where they aren’t welcome anyway. As a bit of a sidebar, a frequent argument that American people of the State make is that the people of the Network owe their veryexistenceto the State. After all, was it not their god, the US government, that funded the internet? Do we not need public monies to back basic research? And shouldn’t the people of the Network therefore dutifully bow their heads and submit, joyfully paying ever more in tribute to the sacred Uncle Sam? There are a few responses to this. One is that the antecedent of the people of the Network were the pre-internet industrialists, who certainly were not well treated by the State in the early 1900s. Another is that while the UK similarly gave rise to the US insomesense, Americans do not genuflect in the direction of the British Isles five times per day. But the deepest response starts by acknowledging a kernel of truth: therewasa period from roughly 1933-1970 when the centralized US government did the Hoover Dam, the Manhattan Project, and Apollo. The transistor and early internet came out of this era as well. And there were some later innovations also catalyzed by the State (albeit often bynon-bureaucratswho managed to commandeer bureaucrat funds) like the Human Genome Project and the self-driving car. However, both beforeandafter this period, the centralized State was not the locus of technical and scientific innovation. That should be obvious today for anything in digital technology; academia has been raided by tech companies and venture capitalists. But it’s also true for the periodbeforethe (well-intentioned) Vannevar Bush memo that kicked off the government centralization of science. After all, most of physics — from Newton to Maxwell to Einstein — was discovered before the National Science Foundation (NSF) was even created. That said, let’s talk about the 1933-1970 period itself. This period of “peak state” was real, but in overstated form it has become the basis for books like Mazzucato’sEntrepreneurial State— which I disagree with, and which Mingardi and McCloskey have rebutted at length in theMyth of the Entrepreneurial State. Here’s why I disagree with the thesis of theEntrepreneurial State: So, it’s true that there was a period mid-century where all other actors besides the US and USSR were squashed down and centralized states dominated innovation. But it’s not because they were necessarily better atinnovating, it’s because they were better atdominating, due to the centralized tech of that time. It was more about the Enormous State than the Entrepreneurial State. And that’s why the technological progressives of the Network don’t reflexively genuflect before the political progressives of the State. Someone who worships an almighty God won’t readily change their beliefs. Neither will someone who worships an almighty State. Once in a while, a religious millenarian’s belief is put to the test when there’s a concrete prediction made by the faith that doesn’t pan out. That’s also what happened for the “secular” believers in communism when the Berlin Wall and then the Soviet Union fell. These events are always fascinating for the non-believer - whether it’s Heaven’s Gate, QAnon, “Mueller Day,” or the “withering of the state”, it’s interesting to see what happens when a prophecy doesn’t work out.62 Indeed, that’s why people wrote books likeThe God that Failedwhen they turned away from communism. A Leviathan had given up the ghost. Whether that Leviathan was God itself or the State, it was a crushing collapse of faith. As per the book of the same title,Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More. This offers a useful way of thinking about the blue and red statists alike, the left-authoritarians and the secular nationalists we discussedearlier. The American State is their God replacement, and they truly can’t envision a world without it. Whether they think of it in terms of “the Constitution” (the conservative framing) or “our democracy” (the progressive framing), the civic religion of the USistheir religion, especially when faith in God has fallen off a cliff. So, they may not be dispassionately rational when forecasting whether their God, the State, might fail. There are three ideas that are helpful here. Put these ideas together and you start to get a mental model of the base-raters, the blue and red statists. They think everything will always stay the same, that it’ll stick at a base rate. The only cycles they’re familiar with are short ones: the cycle of breath over a few seconds, the cycle of sleep over one day, and the cycle of seasons over one year. But they aren’t familiar with any cycle that extends beyond one human life, because they usually don’t know much history beyond what the establishment has pointed them towards. Because they don’t think about cycles, they don’t think about curves. They live on a kind of Flatland, except rather than being flat as in the sense of two-dimensional, it’s flat as in the sense of a curve withzero-derivative. But asRay Daliohas noted, things may not stay flat in historical terms for long. As such, the blue and red statists may be in for a rude shock. Using the lens of the Leviathans, they really think their God, the State, can never fail. Next Section: If the News is Fake, Imagine History",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. The collision of Leviathans has knocked something loose. Access to all that information from the Network has changed our perception of the present, and with it the perception of the past. The historical inevitability and (even more importantly) thedesirabilityof the US establishment’s victory over all opponents is now very much in question. Both outside and inside the US, there’s the sense that the US-dominated postwar order is eitheron its last legsoralreadyover, and that the ancient legislators and endless remakes reflect a fading culture trying to hang on by its fingernails to prevent what comes next. Though people are gearing up as if on autopilot for a Second Cold War, it’s not obvious that the US will make it out of the first round given its internal Cold Civil War. The decline in state capacity, in internal alignment, in budgetary resources, in wherewithal, and in political will is tangible. It’s true that the most dedicated establishmentarians do still operate as if the empire will always be there. But the question of what America’s role in the world should be next remains unanswered, because the question of what America representsat homeremains unanswered. Within the US, groups on both right and left are now asking themselves in different ways:are we the baddies? The left asks whether the US isinstitutionallyracist, the right asks whether the US is irredeemably leftist, and more factions on each side63want anationaldivorce. As we can see from thegraphs, America is not really a single “nation state” anymore; it’s at least binational, with two warring groups. There’s been a collapse ininstitutional trust, and in each other. And the questions now arising are fundamental. My perhaps idiosyncratic answers to these questions are: no, no, no, no, and yes. No, I don’t think the US establishment is nowadays on balance a force for good abroad or at home, or that the US model would be cloned today by someone setting up a new state, or that the US establishment can be trusted to tell the truth. I do, however, think the Cold War America of 1945-1991 was on balance better for its citizens and allies than its Soviet opponents. But while I can justify64these answers, my responses aren’t as important as why these questions are arising in the first place. The reason is that the US establishment has lost control over the narrative. The distortion of the present, and the past, has caught up to them. “If the news is fake, imagine history.” Thispithy tweetreverses Orwell, because he who is acknowledged to be faking the present can no longer distort the past. That is, once enough people see that the establishment has been lying about today’s events, they naturally begin to think the establishment might have been lying about yesterday’s news as well. To calibrate this, let’s start with a grab bag of media failures from the recent present, the last 5-15 years or so. You’ll no doubt have your own list. You probably didn’t remember that last one, mainly because therewasminimal coverage, but watchthisand then ask why you’ve never heard of it before. In each of these cases, we have something predicted to go to zero that ends up at millions, or a certainty that winds up a nullity, or a hot war featuring the US military and 482 suicide car bombings that somehow registered on the public consciousness as zero. If the US establishment could erase Mosul from memory in the age of the internet, you start to see how Putin’s Russia could pretend the 2022 invasion of Ukraine was just a “special operation.” And you start to realize that it’s not sufficient to simply “take the articles with a grain of salt”, and discount them a bit. By listening to the establishment, your perception of reality may be off by one million fold. There are a few common patterns here, ways in which the information supply chain has been distorted. Channel distortion.That which favors the US establishment is magnified 100X, while that which disfavors it is downranked 100X or silenced entirely, such that the net distortion is 10,000X or more. We can think of this as analogous tochannel distortionin signal processing. Media corporations aren’t just censors, they’resensors- and self-interested ones. That is, they’re ostensibly measuring the world, but they actually have self-interested reasons for reporting that some numbers are low (like inflation and crime) and others are high (like whatever social ill they want to address). There are many such channel distortions, including (a) absence of criticism of media owners, (b)A/B testingto promote literalhate speechfor more clicks, (c) self-referential quoting to give the impression of impartiality, and so on. Narrative alignment.The way the establishment determines what to put on the front page out of millions of possible stories should remind you of the political power theory of history. It’s only things that support the narrative: their favored state policies will always succeed, their disfavored tech competitors will always fail, their errors are honest mistakes, your errors are firing offenses, the opponents of the establishment are x-ists and traitors, free speech is the enemy, and so on. Quantitatively speaking, it’d be relatively straightforward to useword2vecor something more recent to literally score and rank stories for their narrative alignment. Power over truth.In these incidents, if you stop to count, you often realize that the reports were off not by say 50%, but by 1000X or more. Why do these “reporters” still have their jobs, then? Because their job wasn’t to make money, but to make power. That is, they weren’t trying to predict the future correctly for the sake of making good investments, but to repeat the party line to keep people in line. They’re like actors, in that their role was to say (or write) the right thing at the right time, to manufacture your consent, to misinform you about everything from weapons of mass destruction to the probability of inflation, and to then claim democratic legitimacy after people voted on the basis of theirofficial misinformation. Comparison to an aligned sensor.It’s worth comparing the reports by these media corporations to reports by an aligned sensor, one where there is no way for the sensor to “win” at your expense by distorting the information it’s giving to you. Your gas tank does not report that the gas is at 90% before suddenly dropping to 20%. Your bank account does not zoom up in order to fake you out and get you to buy something from the bank, and then silently down again, like an establishment journalist trying to manipulate someone before an election. The metrics on your dashboard at work are not typically falsified by people to make them more sensational. In each of these cases, you are receiving reports from either a dispassionate machine or an institution (like your company) where you have economic alignment and no significant principal/agent issues. By contrast, the media corporation can report false information to you and still make money; it has a mind and wallet of its own, unlike the sensors you own. Network rescue.Note something else: theonlyreason you are hearing about these incidents, and the only reason the rebuttals to them ever came out in the first place, is the Network. It is only because the State’s filtering of social media is not yet complete, that their downranking of dissident voices not fully efficient, that their late-breaking attempt to impose speech and thought controls on a free society not fully consummated, that (a) the initial refutations were even published and (b) that you are seeing some of them combined into one document. This last point is worth hovering on. Why do we know about these distortions of the present? It’s again because of a collision of Leviathans, because the Network routed information around the State, giving peopleactualrather than ostensible freedom of speech. We elaborate on this in theFragmentation Thesis, but the Network is accelerating a great decentralization of Western society that began shortly after the peak centralization of about 1950. Towards the end of this process, in our current era, the US establishment got so fat and happy that it forgot how aggressive its predecessors had been in imposing speech and thought controls. Basically, the establishment didn’t realize they’d inherited a highly regulated, centralized communications apparatus where the vast majority of Americans had no practical freedom of speech unless they owned a media corporation or were employed by one. As such, in the 1990s and 2000s, the American establishment could seem to eat its cake and have it too — enjoying the rhetorical windfall of claiming to have a free society, while in practice holding an enormous distribution advantage over the common man (“never argue with a man who buys ink by the barrel”). Now, itwastrue that the US was more free than the USSR, but it is not true that the US was more free than the Internet. As we discusslater, social media is Americanglasnostand cryptocurrency is Americanperestroika. So as the internet scaled, and Americansactuallygot the rights to free speech and free markets that they were nominally promised, the establishment started to feel threatened. Why? Because while speech only influences volitional behavior (like voting), volitional behavior in turn influences coercive behavior (like legislating). So, if the US establishment lost control over speech they would have lost control over everything. Thus began the great Counter-Decentralization in 2013, the techlash plus the Great Awokening, what Jack Bratich calls a “war of restoration” by an establishment that had been economicallydisruptedby the Network but that retained the capability to morally denounce its enemies. The threatened US establishment increased the volume of attacks on their rivals in both senses of the term; the sheer quantity of attacks and the level of vitriol soared, as you can seefrom the charts. Their rivals were basically everyone — tech, Trump, China, Russia, Israel, Brazil, Hungary, Brexiteers, Macron — everyone that wasn’t a loyal part of the US establishment’s social network. And from 2013-2020, against all odds, this multifront campaign seemed to be working. America’s establishment spent down huge amounts of reputation, but they managed to wokify Google, Amazon, Apple, and the major tech companies, deplatform Trump and get him out of office, andterrorize the country with massive riots. They completely reversed course65from the Obama era, silently stole the China issue from Trump, and polarized relations with Russia. They canceled, deplatformed, demonized, and dominated for the better part of a decade. Then, suddenly, after February 2021, there was a distinct slackening of support, of intensity. The coalition that had predated Trump, that had arguably caused Trump, didn’t seem to outlive Trump. At the time of writing, it’s hard to tell whether this is a momentary shift or a permanent one, but social engagement is down. People have tuned out. The US establishment is only talking to their hardcore supporters now. All the other social networks they’ve attacked — essentially everyone in the world who isn’t a true blue American State-worshipper — they aren’t listening anymore. Instead, they’re reassessing their relationship with the US establishment, and with the US itself. The distortion of America’s present has led people to re-evaluate America’s past. Once they realize they’ve had Gell-Mann Amnesia, they start to wonder if their mental model is one of Gell-Mann America. Recall thatGell-Mann Amnesiarefers to the phenomenon where you read something in the paper about an area you have independent knowledge of. Suppose it’s computer science. When you read articles on the topic, you see grievous falsehoods, and inversions of cause and effect. Then you turn the page and read about, say, Palestine as if the reporting on that topic was trustworthy. You forget what you just saw, that the reporting was flawed in the area where you could independently check it. You get amnesia. The mechanistic reason for Gell-Mann Amnesia is the hub-and-spoke topology of the pre-internet information environment. Suppose you were an expert in computer science, another person was an expert on Japan, a third knew about the bond market, and so on. You are spokes that are all connected to the hub (say, The New York Times) but not each other. Each spoke has superior local information, and can falsify NYT reports in their own domain, but has no mechanism for coordinating with other spokes, let alone establishing a superior hub. Until the internet, the blockchain, and the advent ofcryptohistory. The long-term consequence of Gell-Mann Amnesia is Gell-Mann America. People know now that we are systematically misled about the present. But at least we live in the present, so we have local information that can falsify many news stories. We do not live in the past, so all we know is that we may be wildly off-base in our understanding of history. There are no people from the past around to give first hand accounts…though we can read their books and sometimes watch their films. Here are some quick links that may surprise you about the past. And that’s just66the 20th century, with a focus on the Cold War! Once you start seeing that many dissonant facts, plenty of them from the same organizations like The New York Times Company that call themselves the “paper of record” and the “first draft of history,” that literally run billboards calling themselves the “Truth”…you start to realize that there is anunreliable narratorproblem. What if Sulzberger is more likeKeyser Söze? What if his employees are highly self-interested professional prevaricators? What if they’ve always been like that? What if you can’t trust anything they say, and by extension anything the US establishment says, without checking it yourself? As the Cold War ended, and the internet rose in the late 1990s, a spate of movies came out —The Matrix,Memento,The Truman Show,Fight Club,The Game,Men in Black,The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind–— all about a constructed reality where our memories aren’t real. It’s almost as if with the rise of the Network, that there was a dim realization in the collective subconscious that everyone had been lied to, deceived, anesthetized, sedated by the centralized States of the 20th century — not just by the fascists and the communists, but the democratic capitalists too. Just like someone who grew up in China and migrated to the US in adulthood would find that they’d have been lied to — that Mao wasn’t really “7 parts good and 3 parts bad,” but far worse than that — those who grew up in the US and migrated to theInternetin adulthood are starting to realize that something is up. The reason is that the American establishment didn’t really understand what the internet would mean for them. Because during the 20th century they’d made obvious-but-threatening truths, like the existence ofSoviet spiesin the US, rude to talk about. Then a progression happened: after the obvious became rude, the rude became unsayable, the unsayable became unthinkable, and the unthinkable went unthought. And once it went unthought, it was no longer even thought about as a potential threat. Moreover, the original people who’d consciously suppressed that obvious-but-threatening truth had passed away. So these unthought ideas were then sitting there waiting in a dusty tome, waiting for someone to happen upon them, and accidentally rediscover them and put them on the internet. WhetherGoogle BooksorWikileaksor theSoviet archivesor the censorship-resistant web, there are now too many secrets in plain view. The question now is whether a newly awakened US establishment can use its control of chokepoints like Google and its various “fact-checkers” to suppress access to these inconvenient truths, or whether web3-mediated services will make it permanently difficult for the State to suppress the Network. You as the reader may have some input on that. As a not-so-side note, in addition to falsified newspapers and history textbooks, your distorted impression of the past — your Gell-Mann America — likely comes from movies, to a greater extent than you might think. If you haven’t studied something in depth, your mental model of it often implicitly reduces to a few scenes from a Hollywood movie. Let’s call this phenomenon “Jurassic Ballpark.” If you recall the scene fromJurassic Parkwhere they splice inamphibian DNAto spackle over the gaps in their genetic reconstruction, that’s similar to what media consumption has done to your brain.67You’re unconsciously splicing movie scenes into real-life as a ballpark approximation. The gaps in your knowledge have been filled in by TV and movies. These are unreliable narrators. For example: What’s your image of the US military? Often something fromTop GunorTransformers. Even the negative portrayals depict it as all-powerful.68 What’s it like to run a business? Theevil CEOis aTV trope. Countless stories cast a corporation with limitless resources69as the main bad guy, from theTerminatorfranchise toLost. Who’s going to save us from the virus? Why, the competent public servants at the CDC, as portrayed inContagion. By contrast, you very rarely see depictions of journalists, activists, professors, regulators, and the like asbad guys. The public lacks televised narratives for how people in those roles can go wrong. That’s why the behavior of journalists in real life was such a surprise toPaul Graham: One of the biggest surprises of my adult life is how unethical reporters are. In movies they’re always the good guys. “In movies they’re always the good guys.” Indeed! If you think about it, superheros are literally portrayed as journalists (that’s the day job of both Clark KentandPeter Parker), and journalists are likewise portrayed as superheros (see movies likeSpotlightandThe Post). TheIntrepid Reporteris as much of a stock character as theEvil Corporation.70You don’t hear much about the evil reporter, though. You don’t hear much about the evil communist, either. Why? More than 20 years ago,Reason Magazineran a story that still holds up well today, calledHollywood’s Missing Movies, about how the film industry airbrushed the drama of the Cold War out of the 20th century. So it’s not just that the movie industry ran positive portrayals of US establishment journalists, they also ran positive portrayals of out-and-out communists - butI repeat myself.71 There are exceptions. Once in a while you do see aHouse of Cardsthat depicts evilnonprofits,Democrats, andjournalists. Once in a while you do get aDallas Buyers CluborGhostbustersthat depicts evil regulators from theFDAorEPA. And more recently you’ve started to see a few movies that even depict evil communists, not in the interchangeable cartoon villain sense of a Rocky IV, but in the ideological sense - theLives of Others,The Way Back,Bridge of Spies, and theDeath of Stalinrespectively depict the spying, gulaging, imprisoning, murdering Communist states for what they really were. Still, these are very much exceptions.AI video analysiscould quantify this, but if you took the top N most popular movies and TV shows over the past several decades, in terms of raw hours of footage watched, I’d bet the world has seen a >1000:1 ratio of scenes featuring evil capitalists to scenes featuring evil communists. Of course, these are fictional stories, but as Graham’s quote illustrates, they serve as real world archetypes. Even the FDA knows what aTricorderis, and they think of it as “good” only because it was portrayed as good in Star Trek. But most of the time biomedical innovators areportrayed as evil, with all the attendant consequences. False histories shape our reality. We all live in Jurassic Ballpark. Perhaps you now agree that history has been distorted. But we’ve only scratched the surface. While we can’t recapitulate the history of the whole world here, we can recommend some references that show how the past is different than you might think. We have idiosyncratically categorized them as “techno-economic history” and “20th century” history. If you click these links and even skim the books, let alone buy and fully read them, you’ll start to understand the degree of historical distortion in standard textbooks, newspapers, and movies. And you’ll be equipped to answer the fundamental questions we raised at the beginning of this chapter. First, some reading on techno-economic history: Then, some reading on20th Centuryhistory: This is focused on the West and in particular 20th century America, but someone who’d grown up in China could probably prepare a similar list using global sources to debunk various kinds of CCP propaganda. For example, the fact thatNorth Korea is darkmakes China’smovieextolling their military support for the glorious North Korean regime a little darker.

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. New countries begin with new stories. Once we’ve dislodged the “arc of history” from our heads, that thing we didn’t even know was there, the story that told us of the US establishment’s inevitability and institutional goodness…once we’ve realized just how similar that story is to the USSR’s similar narrative of inevitability and institutional goodness…once we’ve realized we can’t count on the US establishment to be the “leader of the free world” or even to successfully manage its domestic affairs anymore…what’s left? We’re going to need new stories. Movies where the big decision doesn’t end up on the US president’s desk, where the US military isn’t counted on to save us from aliens. News feeds that don’t put American events by default on the frontpage. Supply chains and digital services that don’t rely on an increasingly unpredictable and anarchic America. Stories that decenter the US, in other words, but that still give the world hope. That movie point is a disorienting one, isn’t it? You might be tempted to say it’s not important. But it’s all-important. We don’t tell fictional stories about the Kazakhstani military saving the world because it wouldn’t berealistic. And after 2021, it isn’t realistic to make stories about the US establishment saving the world either. For example, a movie like 2011’sContagionthat depicts a competent CDC is now just too far away from reality to permit suspension of disbelief. So instead we get a movie like 2021’sDon’t Look Up, which depicts a chaotic America that’s still somehow the center of events, still the country which the world relies on, but whose internal chaos causes it to fall short. The next movie in that imaginary trilogy will probably not center America. What could it center instead? Unfortunately, the default right now would be to center China. The Chinese are after all putting out blockbuster movies likeWolf Warrior 2andBattle of Lake Changjinwheretheybeat the Americans, save the world, and end up as number one. They have that civilizational confidence. And these movies are not laughable like they would have been even a decade ago. China is a real contender for the crown, unlike Chad or Chile. So that’s the set of stories that is waiting in the wings. One response is to deny this and double down on American nostalgia, rolling outTop Gun: Maverickand electing people born in the 1940s forever. This is what the US establishment is currently doing, hanging on for dear life to the postwar order, denying that any change is underway — and thereby refusing to gracefully adapt. Another response is to come up with new stories that center neither China nor America, but that do center certain universal values - and that give a bridge between America and what comes next, as America itself was a bridge between the British Empire and the post-WW2 world. We give four concrete examples in this chapter. But to be clear, just because a story decenters America doesn’t mean it has to bepunitive. That is, these stories don’t have to condemn the US, anymore than the postwar order of 1945-1991 put the UK in the dock, or the 1991-2021 order really beat up on the Soviets that much. Indeed, a new story could well feature past aspects of the US in laudatory ways. The main commonality is that we need new stories that no longer assume the US establishment will continue to be at the center of the world, or else people will be psychologically unprepared for that eventuality. Another way of thinking about it is that the right kind of new story turns constants into variables. Just as Bitcoin turned the constant of the US dollar into a variable, we need new stories that turn the constant of the US establishment into a variable. By decentering the US establishment in our mental models, we enable decentralization. We envision a world where the US may not be there for us, because it was not always there in the past, and may not endure far into the future. Here are four such stories. The first is the tale of the fragmentation of the postwar consensus. The second is a generalization of Fredrick Jackson Turner’s frontier thesis. The third recapitulates the Fourth Turning concept from Strauss and Howe, as well as Turchin and Dalio’s work, all of which predict significant conflict to come in the West. The fourth talks about how our future is our past, how the mid-20th century is like a funhouse mirror moment, and how we are now seeing a bizarre phenomenon where we repeat past events but get opposite outcomes. All of them turn constants into variables, as they describe a pre-American era where the US didn’t yet exist, and thereby prepare us for a post-American period where the US in its current form no longer exists. The Sovereign Individual, written in 1999, is an incredible book that nailed many aspects of our digital future decades in advance, Bitcoin prime among them. We won’t recapitulate the whole thing here, but in short the thesis is that after many generations in which technology favored centralization (railroads, telegraph, radio, television, movies, mass production) since about 1950 it is now favoring decentralization (transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency). So by this measure, peak centralization was about 1950, when there was one telephone company (AT&T), two superpowers (US/USSR), and three TV stations (ABC/CBS/NBC). Even though the 1950s are romanticized in the US, and there were certainly good things about the era, that level of centralization was not natural. This was an enormous degree of cultural homogenization, conformity, and sameness relative to the pre-1914 world just a few decades prior. Many aspects of individual initiative, creativity, and freedom had been dulled down or eliminated in the standardization process. Read William H. Whyte’sThe Organization Manor James Burnham’sManagerial Revolutionfor a portrait of this midcentury time period. At the time, the mid-century US was more corporatist than entrepreneurial. Yes, the system was capitalism, but a highly managed and regulated sort of capitalism. It was all about joining the big company and working your way up, not founding one, except for the rare and just beginning startup phenomenon on the West Coast, which was a million-fold less common than it is now. Everything was significantly to the economic left and social right of where it is today. Yes, the USA wasn’t communist, but it did have 90% top marginal tax rates, to stop any new people from getting rich and potentially threatening the system FDR built. Similarly, the USSR was far more socially conservative than is commonly remembered, doing things like taxing childless women to reduce their status if they didn’t reproduce. Typically, those who complain about filter bubbles are actually complaining that there is more than one. Namely, they are annoyed that all information doesn’t derive from establishment sources only. That situation actually did obtain in the mid-century US, when tens of millions of Americans all assembled in their living rooms at the same time to watchI Love Lucy. Then it all decentralized, fragmented. The story is told in essays like Paul Graham’s “Refragmentation,” and inThe Sovereign Individual. And we call this the Fragmentation thesis. In the late 1800s, Fredrick Jackson Turner gave an influential talk on the concept of the frontier as the crucial driving force in American history. At that time, it was understood that the free land of the frontier was crucial to the US in several ways - as a way for the ambitious to seek their fortunes, as a national aspiration in the form of Manifest Destiny, as bare land for social experiments. Today, of course, the concept of the frontier and Manifest Destiny is not only not admired, but has been pathologized since the 60s by the same deconstructionism that is one half of wokeness. You know the story: the American frontiersmen, like Columbus before them, were racists, colonialists, and imperalists.72 But two points on this before we proceed. The first is that there wereNtribes fighting in the Americas before the arrival of the Spanish, the British, and the like. The Europeans simply representedtribesN+1,N+2, and so on. Had one of the Native American tribes developed a technological edge over any of the European tribes, had they invented oceanic navigation, they would likely have invaded Europe. We can infer this because (a) when the Mongols had a similartechnological edgethey did invade Europe and (b) many North American tribes were bycontemporaneous accountspeople accustomed to war. So, it’s old-fashioned, but it’s probably healthier to think of the Native Americans more like the 300 Spartans than as helpless victims — brave warriors who fought valiantly but lost to superior forces. The second is that if you read books like Reich’sWho We Are and How We Got Here, it makes clear that history is a boneyard. Contra the opening notes ofMicrosoft’s recent Ignite conference, there’s probably not a single ethnic group on the planet that simply peacefully occupied their plot of land since “time immemorial.” One tribe’s homeland was once their distant ancestors’ frontier. So, with that as preface, let’s generalize the frontier thesis. One way of thinking about it is that the frontier actually opened in 1492, well before the founding of the Americas. What’s little known is that Columbus’ voyage to the New World was in part driven by theOttoman blockadeof the Eastern Mediterranean; it was an attempt to find an alternative path to India around the Ottomans, but it ended up using technology to reopen the frontier in the face of political roadblocks. From 1492 to 1890, Europeans had what they considered a frontier. It started withtransatlantic navigationand the discovery of the New World, then proceeded to European colonialism, and from there to the independence of the US and Western expansion via Manifest Destiny. Towards the end of this period, authors like Charles Nordhoff inCommunistic Societies of the United Statesnoted how important the frontier was, how bad it would be if that avenue for ambitious men was closed off, and how nasty the Trade-Unionists were getting. Hitherto, in the United States, our cheap and fertile lands have acted as an important safety-valve for the enterprise and discontent of our non-capitalist population. Every hired workman knows that if he chooses to use economy and industry in his calling, he may without great or insurmountable difficulty establish himself in independence on the public lands; and, in fact, a large proportion of our most energetic and intelligent mechanics do constantly seek these lands… I do not doubt that the eagerness of some of our wisest public men for the acquisition of new territory has arisen from their conviction that this opening for the independence of laboring men was essential to the security of our future as a free and peaceful state… Any circumstance, as the exhaustion of these lands, which should materially impair this opportunity for independence, would be, I believe, a serious calamity to our country; and the spirit of the Trades-Unions and International Societies appears to me peculiarly mischievous and hateful, because they seek to eliminate from the thoughts of their adherents the hope or expectation of independence. The member of a Trades-Union is taught to regard himself, and to act toward society, as a hireling for life; and these societies are united, not as men seeking a way to exchange dependence for independence, but as hirelings, determined to remain such, and only demanding better conditions of their masters. If it were possible to infuse with this spirit all or the greater part of the non-capitalist class in the United States, this would, I believe, be one of the gravest calamities which could befall us as a nation; for it would degrade the mass of our voters, and make free government here very difficult, if it did not entirely change the form of our government, and expose us to lasting disorders and attacks upon property. Nordhoff was right. The aggression of the Trade-Unions eventually led to the communist revolutions which killed tens of millions of people globally, led to “lasting disorders and attacks upon property”, and generally became the bane of the world. We can attribute some of this to the pause, to the closing of the frontier in 1890. That closing took away paths for ambitious men, and ensured that they couldn’t easily become founders on their own plot of land - they had to become union organizers, or revolutionaries, or demagogues of some kind. Without the frontier, it all became zero sum. And thus we entered the steel cage match of the 20th century between fascism, communism, and democratic capitalism. There were some important frontier-related technological developments during this period in space shuttles (and cruise ships!), but the frontier itself was not open. Humanity managed to survive through a bloody 20th century. After 1991, the frontierreopenedas commerce on the internet was legalized. By the late 2010s, the combination of centralization and wokification (in the West) and Xi-ification (in China) threatened to close this frontier too, but BTC and web3 and the open metaverse have given the digital frontier a new lease on life. Today, if we assess where we’re at, there arefour possibilitiesfor the frontier: the land, the internet, the sea, and space. Right now, there are 7.7B people on land, 3.2B on the internet, about 2-3M on the high seas, and less than 10 currently in space. So, practically speaking, an “internet frontier” is easier than the other three. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to use the concepts from the network state to reopen the physical frontier, through a hybrid internet/land strategy, as described in this book. To summarize, (a) the period of European greatness corresponded to the open frontier from 1492-1890, (b) the period of total war corresponded to the closing frontier from 1890-1991 which ushered in a necessarily zero-sum world, (c) the peaceful reopening of the digital frontier could lead the world again (and not just the Europeans) to a time of greatness, (d) the American and Chinese establishments are trying to close that frontier and trap us into the same steel cage match of the 20th century, (e) but with sufficiently good technology we might be able to escape these political roadblocks and (f) reopen not just a digital frontier, but a physical one: on remote pieces of land, on the sea, and eventually in space. This is what we refer to as the generalized Frontier thesis. The Fourth TurningandAges of Discordboth predict very significant unrest within the US in the coming years. Ray Dalio does as well inPrinciples for Dealing with the Changing World Order, though he confines most of his comments to monetary apocalypse. Their models are somewhat related. The Fourth Turningcame out in 1997 and is based on a quasi-cyclical theory of Anglo-American history, where conflict erupts roughly every 75 years. If you believe in these patterns and want a possible underlying driver of them, 75 years is about one long human lifespan. So perhaps those who do not remember73history reallyaredoomed to repeat it. Turchin’s predictions came out around 2008 in aNature article, and he’s written them up at length inWar and Peace and War. He has impressive timestamped graphs with specific forecasts as to why conflict will rise, using various measures for societal instability like elite overproduction and the wage share of the masses. Dalio’s thesis is that we’re about to experience events that have never happened before in our lives, but have happened many times before in history. He goes back further than the Fourth Turning to the British and Dutch empires, and has some quasi-quantitative analysis to support his view. All three of these works predict significant physical and/or monetary conflict in America in the 2020s, and (in Dalio’s case) a consequent changing of the world order. We call this the Fourth Turning Thesis. Take a look at this video ofunmixinga fluid. Isn’t that bizarre? You can see the same process going backward in time, in an unexpected way. This is not the kind of trajectory we expect to see, but it happens under certain conditions. And it’s one model for what’s happening in the world, as we redecentralize after a century of centralization. In other words, an important consequence of the fragmentation thesis is that our future may be more like our past. If peak centralization was around 1950, with one telephone company (AT&T) and two superpowers (US, USSR) and three television stations (ABC, CBS, NBC), we growmoredecentralized as we move ineitherdirection from that point. Essentially, the invention of the transistor in 1947 is like a mirror moment. And as you go forward and backward in time you start to see events repeating, but as funhouse mirror versions of themselves, often with the opposite outcome.Our future is our past. Let’s go through some examples: We can think of more examples, with respect to the emerging Second Cold War. And if we go back further in time: The careful observer will note that these events aren’t all happening in exactly the same reverse order. It’s not A/B/C/D and then D/C/B/A like a melody. Moreover, the first set of events is more spaced out over time, while the second is highly clumped together, with internet-era events years, rather than decades, apart. Finally, the repetition of each event is often not exactly the same as the previous, but often a “version 3.0.” For example, Bitcoin is not simply thesameas gold, but a version 3.0 that combines some aspects of gold and some aspects of digitized fiat currencies. Still, there seems to be something going on. What’s the unifying theory here? One model, as just discussed in theFragmentation Thesis, is that technology favored centralization in the West and especially the US from arguably 1754-1947 (Join, or Diein the French and Indian War, unified national government post-Civil War, railroads, telegraph, radio, television, movies, mass media in general, and mass production). And technology is now favoring decentralization from roughly 1950 to the present day (transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency). So, in the West, the grip of the centralized state has begun to slacken. The East is a different matter; after a century of communism, socialism, civil war, and Partition, China and India are more internally unified than they’ve been in a long time. Before we immediately jump to thinking that world is ending, though, we should note that during theriseof Western centralized power people (understandably) complained about centralized power and homogeneity, just as today during thefallof Western centralized power they are complaining about fragmentation and lack of common voice. That doesn’t mean we’ve come full circle, exactly. As per the helical theory of history, we might have progressedorregressed. But there may be an underlying cycle: “the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.” Anyway, this model would explain why we’re seeing an inversion: there was an upward arc that favored the centralized State, but now we’re in the middle of a downward arc that favors the decentralized Network.74So various historical events are recurring with the opposite results, like the fluid flowing in reverse. And that’s the thesis on how our Future is Our Past. Next Section: Left is the New Right is the New Left",book

https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment,"Title: The One Commandment
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Every new startup society needs to have a moral premise at its core, one that its founding nation subscribes to, one that is supported by a digital history that a more powerful state can’t delete106, one that justifies its existence as a righteous yet peaceful protest against the powers that be.107 To be clear, it’s a huge endeavor to go and build an entire moral edifice on par with a religion, and work out all the practical details. We’re not advising you come up with your own Ten Commandments! But we do think you can come up withonecommandment. One new moral premise. Just one specific issue where the history and science has convinced you that the establishment is wanting. And where you feel confident making your case in articles, videos, books, and presentations. These presentations are similar to startup pitch decks. But as the founder of a startup society, you aren’t a technology entrepreneur telling investors why this new innovation is better, faster, and cheaper. You are amoral entrepreneurtelling potential future citizens about a better way of life, about a single thing that the broader world has gotten wrong that your community is setting right. By focusing on just one issue, you can set up a parallel society with manageable complexity, as you are changing only one civilizational rule. Unlike a political party, you’re not offering a package deal on many issues that people only shallowly care about. With the one commandment you are instead offering asingle issuecommunity, and attracting not single-issue voters but single-issuemovers. Just as a note on terminology, we consider astartup societyto be a new community built internet-first, premised on a societalcritiqueof its parent community, and founded for the purpose of addressing that specific societal problem in an opt-in way – namely, by recruiting people online to voluntarily form an alternative society that shows a better way. The implication is that a startup society is still pretty small and near the beginning of its ambition, just like a startup company. Aparallel societyis roughly equivalent to a startup society, but the implication is that it could be much larger in scale. It’s parallel because it stands apart from mainstream society as a parallel version, as a fork. It’s not set up inoppositionto the mainstream on every dimension, but a parallel societyiscertainly differentiated from the mainstream on a key axis. You can think of the relationship between “startup society” and “parallel society” as similar to the relationship between “startup” and “tech company”; the former is early stage, while the latter can be of any stage. The analogy works in another way. Just like a “tech company” can refer to a fully remote organization, a partially physical company with some office space, or a globally recognized multinational like Google, a “parallel society” is also an umbrella term that can denote a wholly digital network union, a partially physical network archipelago, or a diplomatically recognized network state. That’s important, because you may be able to realize the goals of your startup society with a purely digital network union, you may need the physical footprint of a network archipelago, or you might need the formal legal recognition of a full network state. It all depends on the nature of your one commandment: can it be accomplished purely at the community level, does it require a physical buildout, or does it require changes to the legal system? A few specific examples will make this clear. We’ll describe startup societies based on a wholly digital network union, others based on a partially physical network archipelago, and yet others that need diplomatically recognized network states. Let’s start with an easy example of a one commandment-based startup society, which only requires a purely digital network union and doesn’t require a full physical footprint like a network archipelago, let alone diplomatic recognition like a network state. This is the cancel-proof society. Suppose you’re the hypothetical founder of this startup society. You begin with a history of the last 15 years showing all the bizarre examples of social media cancellation, something like Jon Ronson’sSo You’ve Been Publicly Shamed. You note that these cancellations represent a moral failure by the people of the State and the CEOs of the Network. Their partisan warfare and engagement algorithms trapped many innocents in the crossfire of social war. Now a stray comment by a civilian is routinely turned into a human sacrifice to make an ideological point. It’s as if a passerby took such offense to your offline comment to a friend that they opened fire. Those who agree that normal online behavior shouldn’t come with risk of a social death penalty imposed by random people are the basis of your new society. They agree with your historically informed, moral critique. And the one commandment may be something like “cancellation without due process is bad”. How do you implement this? One solution is just a network union that provides a combination of (a) guild and (b) cancellation insurance. You assemble a group of people in a Discord, optionally take a stake in each other by issuing a DAO token, and work together to promote each other’s work and help each other out. This could be a guild of, say, graphic designers or young adult fiction writers or electrical engineers. The token of the DAO would be optional – it wouldn’t be meant to be some massive new thing like Ethereum. It’s just a way to record who contributed time and/or money to the startup society, and how much they did. People would give in order to get, a bit like StackOverflow Karma. And those with more money than time may buy the token to support those in the guild with more time than money. Now, 99% of the time this startup society is just doing “peacetime” activities, like helping people find jobs, organizing promotion for new product launches of members, facilitating introduction, or just hanging out at meetups. But 1% of the time someone in the guild is under social attack. In that situation, the guild can choose to publicly respond as one or — if grievously outnumbered — can quietly support the affected party with a new job after the uproar has died down. In such a circumstance, the one commandment kicks in, and there is internal due process around the attempted cancellation. Did the person actually do something wrong, and if so, is the correct penalty more like a hundred-dollar fine or an apology rather than a career-ruining publicly calumny? The concept is that this kind of startup society serves a dual purpose: it’s useful in “peacetime” but it also gives people a community to fall back on in the event of digital cancellation. And that’s how one could build a cancel-proof culture. Next, let’s do an example which requires a network archipelago (with a physical footprint) but not a full network state (with diplomatic recognition). This is Keto Kosher, the sugar-free society. Start with a history of the horribleUSDA Food Pyramid, the grain-heavy monstrosity that gave cover to the corporate sugarification of the globe and theobesity epidemic. Also discuss the cure in the form of keto and low-carb diets. Then operationalize this cure in the form of a partially physical network archipelago. Organize a community online that crowdfunds properties around the world, like apartment buildings and gyms, and perhaps eventually even culdesacs and small towns. You might take an extreme sugar teetotaller approach, literally banning processed foods and sugar at the border, thereby implementing a kind of “Keto Kosher.” You can imagine variants of this startup society that are like “Carnivory Communities” or “Paleo People”. These would be competing startup societies in the same broad area, iterations on a theme. If successful, such a society might not stop at sugar. It could get into setting cultural defaults for fitness and exercise. Or perhaps it could bulk purchase continuous glucose meters for all members, or orders of metformin. Cars are on balance a good thing. But you can overdo them. Mid-century America did. It obscured the San Francisco waterfront with ugly elevated highways, impeding the walkability of this beautiful area. That highway was removed in the late 20th century.108And the removal was an acknowledgement that sometimes we can have too much of a good thing. 24/7 internet connectivity is like that. It’s good that we’re doing things like Starlink, to bring internet access to the entire world, to provide free online education, and to get them into the global economy. But it’s bad if you can never disconnect from the internet. That’s why apps like “Freedom” are so popular. That’s why people use commitment devices like timed cookie jars to hide their phones. That’s why apps like Twitter and Snapchat got popular on the basis of artificial constraints, like limited characters or disappearing messages, because they were optimizing for fallible humans rather than infallible machines. That’s why Tsinghua cuts off the internet at night, why Apple now provides screen time metrics, and why books likeAtomic HabitsandIndistractiblesell so well. What if this optimization for fallibility didn’t have to be an individual thing? What if there were a society that helped you with internet distractions and self-control, that recognized that the internet was good, but that times and places without the internet were also good — just as cars are good, but a San Francisco waterfront without cars is also good? One way of accomplishing this would be a Digital Sabbath society where the internet is just shut off at night, from 9pm to 9am. Some buildings and rooms would furthermore be enclosed in Faraday cages, to put them offline on purpose. Areas would start to be flagged as online and offline areas, a bit like smoking and non-smoking areas on planes. All internet use would be conscious and focused, as opposed to unconscious and involuntary. Over time, such a society could even try to build apps to give individuals back control over their internet use, with open source machine learning tools running locally on devices in a privacy-protecting way to prioritize notifications, block distractions, and encourage productivity. The Digital Sabbath society is an example of a network archipelago that’s focused on improving self-control around internet use. For obvious reasons, you’d need a physical footprint, and wouldn’t be able to do this purely digitally. Now let’s do a more difficult example, which will require a full network state with diplomatic recognition. This is the medical sovereignty zone, the FDA-free society. You begin your startup society with Henninger’s history of FDA-causeddrug lagand Tabarrok’s history of FDA interference with so-called“off label” prescription. You point out how many millions were killed by its policies, hand out t-shirts likeACT-UP did, showDallas Buyers Clubto all prospective residents, and make clear to all new members why your cause of medical sovereignty is righteous. But to actually achieve personal medical sovereignty, your startup society would need some measure of diplomatic recognition from a sovereign outside the US — or perhaps a state within the US. It would need to actually be what we call a network state, as it would need legal recognition from an existing government. For the case of doing it outside the US, your startup society would ride behind, say, the support of Malta’s FDA for a new biomedical regime. For the case of doing it within the US, you’d need a governor who’d declare a sanctuary state for biomedicine. That is, just like a sanctuary city declares that it won’t enforce federal immigration law, a sanctuary state for biomedicine would not enforce FDA writ. With this diplomatic recognition, you could then take the existing American codebase and add one crucial new feature: the absolute right for anyone to buy or sell any medical product without third party interference. Your body, your choice. That’s how you’d get an FDA-free zone. Now we see why a focused moral critique is so important. It combines (a) the moral fervor of a political movement with (b) the laser-focus of a startup company into (c) a one-commandment based startup society. Such a society is not a total revolution. We aren’t starting completely de novo. Each startup society is simply taking a broken aspect of today’s world, often a State-caused or at least State-neglected calamity, writing the history of that state failure, and then building an opt-in community to solve the problem. It’s a tightly focused parallel society making one impactful change. Why is it so important to introduceonecommandment rather than zero orN? The short answer is that you don’t want to write something as complex as a social operating system from scratch, and in fact others will prevent you from doing so. But you also don’t want to avoid innovating on a broken society. So introducing one (1) tightly focused change at a time in a startup society with opt-in citizens allows testing of the new commandment. The longer answer revolves around an important paradox of modern society: namely, that many people feel uncomfortable evangelizing religious morals, yet very comfortable evangelizing their political ethics. The first part is easy to understand. Westerners are nowadays often shy about telling others to practice their religion. Why? They may feel they haven’t figured it all out, so who are they to say? Or they know they can’t live up to their ideal moral code, like someone who wants to diet but can’t always restrain themselves, so they refrain from commentary to avoid the charge of hypocrisy. They also may not want to be attacked as a crazy cult leader. All of these are understandable hesitations for either (a) evangelizing a traditional religion, (b) inventing a wholly new one, or (c) forking an existing religion. (The last is kind of like starting a new denomination of Protestantism, where you keep much of the old codebase but add in some crucial distinctive factors.) But think about the second part. While there is great hesitation in Western society aroundreligiousevangelism, there is seemingly no hesitation aroundpoliticalevangelism. Indeed,thisis considered an ethical duty, usually in exactly those terms, with the word “ethical” used in place of “moral” but serving a very similar role, and with at least two large competing political parties fighting for the souls/votes of their believers. Therein lies the paradox: while political and religious movements can both be considereddoctrines109, in that they come packaged with a number of directives on how peoplemustlive, the same person who is shy about telling other people about morality is often incredibly confident when yelling at other people about politics. That’s why we advise one commandment for your new startup society. It’s something in between being too shy and too overbearing. It’s in between avoiding religious-sounding evangelism entirely and indulging in political-sounding evangelism too much. Don’t avoid taking a moral stance, because that means you passively succumb to your surroundings. But also don’t try imposing an all-encompassing political ideology to start, because that’s too hard and means total warfare with your surroundings. Instead, just pickoneflaw in modern society that youdofeel confident in building a startup society to redress, and go with that. One commandment, not zero orN. So far we’ve talked about a one commandment, but implied it is anewmoral innovation, like cutting out sugar or limiting internet use. What about older religions, political codes, and moral commandments? You can certainly return to an older knownreligiouscode, adopting it in whole or in part. In a startup society, where everyone opts in, you can make this happen more easily because religion in many countries is mostly about private practice: so long as people agree in a peer-to-peer fashion to practice their religion a certain way, the state allows them to do it. It’s harder to return to an olderpoliticalcode, because you are now talking about public law rather than private law. Still, if you build a large enough startup society, and pick the right laws, there is probably something at the town, city, or province level that you can do — either within the West or outside it. How did the US beat the USSR? Because it built and defended a parallel system. Rewind back to how the Soviet Union fell. As Stephen Kotkin noted in abrilliant interview, the most important fact about the Soviet Union was that they genuinelywerecommunists. Outsiders perceived the Soviets to be cynical, but they were wrong; their cynicism had limits. At the end of the day, the Soviets were devout believers in their ideology. How could it be otherwise? Soviet citizens weren’t stupid, and people knew there were things that didn’t add up, but they were operating within a constrained information environment. The censorship was so pervasive that it controlled thought. The degree of self-deception was so all-encompassing that even thenomenklaturalike Boris Yeltsin didn’t know how truly poor the Soviet Union was till hevisited an American supermarketand threw up his hands at how far behind the USSR was. Unlike Orwell’s O’Brien, the Soviet leaders deceived themselves too. So, fundamentally, any proposed edits by Soviet elites to the USSR would have been just on the margins. They were information and values constrained. They actually needed a totally different system. Yet their system resisted both revolutionary and incremental reform. The solution was theparallel systemof the United States. An alternative society starting from different moral premises that eventually produced undeniably better results. That’s the same basic thing that reformed the People’s Republic of China. The mere existence of successful parallel systems in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and especially Singapore is what drove Deng Xiaoping to adopt capitalism. Ezra Vogel’s book is excellent on this. So, in both cases, it was a parallel system that beat the Soviet system and the Maoist system. In the 20th century, the only way to build a parallel system was to fight and win a war (often a hot one) against the communists or fascists who were intent on conquering your territory. The parallel systems of the US and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were maintained against the USSR and PRC at enormous cost by fighting for large contiguous regions of land. That was a very State-centric approach. In the 21st century, our approach suggests a Network-centric way to build parallel systems: create one opt-in society at a time, purely digitally if need be, justifying it with a historical/moral critique of the present system that delegitimizes State violence against them and allows the experiment to continue. Many will fail, but for those that succeed, we can merge together the good changes and discard the bad ones, and eventually get a parallel society that differs in many respects from (say) the original US codebase, but that maintains enough similarity that it’s “backwards compatible” and citizens can migrate over. Much like the relation of the USA to Europe during the 1800s, this is a way to reproducibly build a New World on the internet to reform existing states. Let’s review. First, by starting with a seemingly simple moral premise and taking to its logical conclusion, a one-commandment-based startup society ends up changing huge swaths of life, but in a focused, exit-constrained, and intellectually consistent way.110Just think about what “keto” really means when it’s extrapolated out to the scale of an entire town, and sugar poisoning is taken as seriously as lead poisoning. Second, one-commandment-based societies allow for scalable, parallel, consensual exploration of sociopolitical space. Different groups that disagree with each other on how to live can nevertheless support the meta-concept of many different one-commandment-based experiments. And indeed, both a carnivore community and vegan village would likely have better health outcomes than the default Western diet, even if these communities disagree on core moral premises. Third, there’s a network effect between societies. Each starts off highly focused, of course — much as a startup company tries to attract customers with a single focused product, each startup society tries to attract subscribers with a single focused commandment. And as with a startup company, any individual experiment towards a new sociopolitical order may succeed or fail. But so long assomeone-commandment-based startup societies succeed, they can copy each other’s proven moral innovations. Fourth, each of these one-commandment-based startup societies is supported by a history. Listen to someone from the Keto Kosher society and they’ll be able to rattle off an account of how the USDA Food Pyramid led to epidemic obesity. Chat with a Benedictine Option monk and you’ll hear about the religious culture they’re trying to preserve. And talk to a citizen of the post-FDA society and they’ll give you a history of the few strengths and many weaknesses of the FDA, from ACT-UP to drug lag. Some such societies are focused on new technologies and some are not, but all of them are based on an ethical code premised on their reading of history. And that’s why history is the foundation of any new startup society. Next Section: NYT, CCP, BTC",book

Content: The Tripolar MomentChapter 3 Narrated by Balaji AI. Today’s world is becoming tripolar. It is NYT vs CCP vs BTC. That’s the American Establishment vs the Communist Party of China vs the Global Internet. Each of these three poles has a source of truth online: paper (NYT), party (CCP111), or protocol (BTC). Each has a digital economy that surrounds that source of truth: the dollar economy, the digital yuan112, or the web3 cryptoeconomy. Each pole is a network in its own right, which standsoutsidethe state; the NYT network gives direction to the American state, the CCP network leads the Chinese state, and the BTC network stands outside all states. And each has a governing ideology. Woke Capital113is the ideology of America’s ruling class as explicated by America’s ruling newspaper, The New York Times. It’s capitalism that enables decentralized censorship, cancel culture, and American empire. It’sdrone-strikedemocracy. Communist Capital is the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s capitalism checked by the centralized power of the Chinese party-state, as summarizedhere: Leninist, Confucianist, Capitalist, and Nationalist. Crypto Capital is the international ideology of Bitcoin and web3. It’s stateless capitalism, capitalism without corporations, decentralized censorship-resistance, and neutral international law. And it’s the second polewithinboth the US and China, the one that domestic regime opponents align around. While superficial aspects of these ideologies may shift with circumstance, we claim these are the only coalitions with the billion-person scale and technological talent to survive as independent power centers in the all-out digital struggle that has already commenced. They do have internal divisions, as we’ll get to, but for the time being every group from companies to states to dissident factionswithinstates will have to navigate between these poles, the tripolar triangle of the digital world.

https://thenetworkstate.com/the-dated-and-the-timeless,"Title: The Dated and the Timeless
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Before we go further, let’s note: anything written about current events is, by its nature, likely to become dated. It is possible, even likely, that the US Establishment sheds its skin once again, downplaying wokeness and emphasizing loyalty to the state, just as they transitioned overnight from the “Global War on Terror” to the domestic war on your tweets.114 It is possible, although less likely, thatGeorge Soros,Peter Zeihan,Gordon Chang, andRoger Garsideeventually prove right, that Xi Jinping is displaced from his position atop the Communist Party of China in the 2022 Party Congress, and/or that the CCP switches back to “Hide your strength and bide your time.” And it is possible, although less likely still, that there is some fatal flaw, mathematical breakthrough, or quantum computer that leads to the irreparable failure of the Bitcoin protocol. So why devote a chapter to the NYT/CCP/BTC model at all, if events can overtake it? Three reasons. First, we needsomemodel of where the world is, even if imperfect, to steer it where we want to go. Even if it’s wrong, or wrong in some particulars, it may be usefully wrong in that the update shows us where we were wrong. We spend the energy to describe a specific tripolar model of the worldbecausemany still think it’s unipolar or bipolar, as illustrated by thisamusing interactionbetween a journalist and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. Second, even if major changes do occur, the decline of American empire, the rise of China, and the ascent of cryptocurrency remain underlying trends involving hundreds of millions of people that would require tremendous force to stop. We’d notice. And we consider a few candidates for such tremendous forceslater. Third, there are aspects of the current moment that are not dated at all, but recurrent. That is, a similar tripolar configuration has occurred before. But first let’s establish how it came about today. Next Section: A Bipolar America and a Tripolar Triangle",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/a-bipolar-america-and-a-tripolar-triangle,"Title: A Bipolar America and a Tripolar Triangle
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. In 1990, as the USSR was clearly falling apart, Charles Krauthammer wrote an influential essay called theUnipolar Moment. It made the point that with the Cold War at an end, the US was the sole dominant power on the planet, and would be for roughly a generation, after which point “multipolarity will come in time.”115This thesis held up well: unipolarity was true in the 1990s, mostly true116in the 2000s, much less true with the rise of Asia, technology, and American polarization in the 2010s, and no longer true in the 2020s. As of 2022, we no longer have a unipolar world. Nor is it just ambiguously multipolar, with an unspecified number of power centers. Instead, we have a bipolar America and a tripolar triangle. And we can visualize these poles as follows: Next Section: Moral Power, Martial Power, Money Power",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/moral-power-martial-power-money-power,"Title: Moral Power, Martial Power, Money Power
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. In the mid-20th century, the decline of the British Empire presaged a three way fight between a moral power, a martial power, and a money power — roughly, left vs right vs center. Back then, the Soviet Union was the moral power, the Nazis were the military power, and the Americans were the money power. Today, NYT is the moral power, CCP is the martial power, and BTC is the money power. In each case, we also find that the moral powerplants molesfor espionage, the martial power excels at manufacturing, and the money power leads in media. But while in the mid-20th century these three powers were states, today they are primarily networks.117 Back up for a second. How could we possibly say that an entity like the USSR, which killed millions of people, was a “moral” power? Because the USSR’sprimarystrategy was Communist proselytization118, the unceasing evangelism of a malign (but convincing) moral doctrine that managed to capturemore than a third of the earth’s populationby mid-century. It did have a colossal military, but spoke endlessly of peace; it seized everyone’s property, but claimed it didn’t care about money; and its self-image was that of saintly selflessness. It is in this sense that the Soviet Union was amoral power. Its moral power119allowed it to plant moles in every country, which compensated for its lack of money and manufacturing. American sympathizers funded the buildout of the Soviet state, handed it diplomatic recognition, distracted Japan on its behalf, supplied it with theLend-Lease Actduring WW2 and nuclear weapons afterward, and generally propped up the USSR throughout its life.120 Nazi Germany also infamously murdered millions of people. While similar to the USSR in many respects, itsprimarystrategy was different. It was an emphasis on martial valor, on pure brute force, on the shells that would supposedly hiss louder than any mere words. It did have an inescapable propaganda apparatus, but its moral preaching was martial; it did leave some money-oriented businesses intact, but said it was socialist; itsraison d’êtrewas ruthless self-interest. It is in this sense that Nazi Germany was amartial power. To support this martial power, the Germans needed a tremendous manufacturing buildout, which they accomplished. Many historians believe the German military had, on a pound-for-pound basis, the best equipment in the war. But because they lacked the capitalist’s ability to cooperate across borders, they drove away some of their best scientists prior to murdering others, ensuring they’d never gain the atomic bomb. And because their morality amounted to Aryan supremacy, which didn’t appeal to anyone other than their co-ethnics, they never managed to build a large enough global coalition to win - which is why the 70M Germans were eventually beaten by the 50M British, the 150M Americans, and the 150M Soviets. As for the mid-century Americans, theirprimarystrategy was democratic capitalism, as opposed to Soviet communism or national socialism. They preached a morality, but framed it in terms of a capitalist-friendly four freedoms; they built an arsenal of democracy, but it arose from their commercial industrial base. It is in this sense that WW2 America was amoney power. Accompanying the money power was media power, just as capitalism went with democracy. The Americans were much better at media than the Nazis (who couldn’t argue in English) and incrementally better than the Soviets (whose propaganda was ultimately undermined by their lack of prosperity). The media battle was a close-run thing, but in the end blue jeans out-competed the Red Army. So: in this tripolar configuration, after a titanic struggle, the money power in the centerdidend up winning over both the martial power on the right (by 1945) and the moral power on the left (by 1991). Today, the decline of the US empire has led to the rise of a moral power (represented by NYT), a martial power (CCP), and a money power (BTC). The difference relative to mid-century is that each of these arenetworksthat are upstream of states, rather than primarily states themselves. The NYT-centered network of journalists “hold[s] power to account” and thereby stands above any mere elected government. Its go-to tactics are moral badgering and mole-driven espionage, just like the Soviet Union. On the moral point, go back and look at any recent NYT headline and note how many of the articles involve amoralrather than factual premise as the core point.Free speechis bad,white peopleare bad,communismwas good…this is the kind of thing they are focused on.121And it is in this sense that NYT is a moral power. On the espionage point, as just discussed, we know that the Soviets were past masters at subversion. Their moral convictions made them feel that invading the privacy of others, stealing secrets, destroying lives withZerzetsung122— all of that was acceptable for the great moral cause of communism. Because they weren’t as good at building as the US or even Germany (the Soviet munitions came from America via Lend-Lease), stealing/destroying was the best thing they could do. Sulzberger’s employees and American journalists in general are similar. They’re the Stasi with a stock symbol, the original surveillance capitalists. It’s always phrased in the passive voice, but how exactly did “TheNewYorkTimesobtain”thethingstheyprint? The story behind the story is more interesting than the story, and the behind the scenes footage would show you a different movie than the one they want you to watch. In short, much like the communists, the journalists’ moral conviction gives them the license todoxx private citizens, to go throughpeople’s garbage, to usesecret identities(and then claimthey don’t), to printhacked data, to solicitleaksof private information while demanding to keep their owninformation private, to induce people tobreak contracts, tostalk peopleat their homes, even tocover up enormous genocidesandstart giant wars…always in the service of thebottom line, and some purported higher good. The establishment journalist claims to speak truth to power, but somehow never gets around to investigating themselves or each other. AsBloomberg admittedin a moment of candor, they “report on but do not investigate Reuters and CNBC” because they are “direct rivals”. We occasionally hear about incidents like the episode where ABC got CBS to fire theRobach leaker, or when NBCtried to stifleRonan Farrow’s work, but those are the just the tip of the iceberg. There’s an enormous incentive for establishment journalists to engage in anti-competitive collusion, because if they all agree on what is “true”, who can then fact-check them? No one can “hold accountable” those with the power to hold the government accountable. This one may require the most explanation as it’s the most foreign to Western experience. First we’ll describe why CCP is primarily anetwork, and then why it’s now mainlymartial. We don’t pretend to be China experts — few are! — but these are relatively basic points that are still not that well known. The CCP network of party members is less separate from the Chinese state, as it doesn’t pretend to be at a great remove from the levers of power as NYT does. But the party is not thesameas the state. Indeed, there are95 millionCCP members, and they don’t all have senior government positions anymore than every registered Democrat has a plum spot in the Biden administration. Instead, they are spread out through society. How does it work? Joining the CCP is itself nontrivial, which selects for the most dedicated members. TheSouth China Morning Postoutlinesthe “arduous” application process: An application must be filed to the applicant’s closest party committee or branch, with a letter explaining: But it doesn’t end there, according toMerics: Applicants must write essays on Marxism-Leninism and on current political developments. Eight colleagues, neighbors and acquaintances have to vouch for an applicant’s reputation. After applying, the applicant must take courses and then pass anexam, only to then be put into a yearlong (at least) probationary period: The applicant will then attend party courses, where he will learn about the party’s constitution, after which he will have to take and pass written tests… Upon passing the tests, the applicant will required to submit more materials to the party branch, including personal information of himself and his parents. Information about his employment and his parents’ political affiliations also have to be disclosed. Probationary party membership will be granted upon: Probation lasts at least a year. At the end of the probation period, the party branch decides whether to admit the applicant, extend the probation or expel him. Lest one misbehave during the probationary period, there are consequences if the applicant does not behave up tostrict standards: In the ensuing one-year probation period, the admission process can still be stopped if “party discipline” is breached. And if you are finally cleared by the Party to join, you have a lifelong commitment to uphold, asMo Chenwrites:123 When the CCP hold a top tier meeting, you will be in your local party branch conference room to watch it live, and write essay on thoughts after view. Natural disasters happen, donate, mandatory. Oh you don’t know where to find the donation box? Don’t worry, it is deducted already from your salary… Everytime the Chairman of China releases important article address the issues of current affairs and overarching strategy for the next five years, you write that article 10 times, handwritten, due tomorrow. Thankfully, these are like, once every five years. If you break the law, no matter how small, you get a “Party Internal Warning” post. And yes, you write [a] reflection essay about what had led you astray, and how wrong you realize you are… If it is serious, you are back to probation period… even more serious? The double policy, you lose both your party status and office title… Seems very alien to a Western mindset! What people would choose to constantly post new essays regurgitating the latest in regime propaganda, and indoctrinating their coworkers and family members? But it all fits if you think of them as China’s New York Times subscribers. Think aboutthis sceneinTeam America: World Police, where the Janeane Garofalo figure says, “As actors, it is our responsibility to read the newspapers, and then say what we read on television like it’s our own opinion.” Then, just swap out the NYT mobile app withXuexi Qiangguo. As thesaying goes, “Party, government, army, society and education, east, west, south and north, the party leads on everything.” It’s almost the same for the American Establishment, except thepaperleads on everything. America’s CCP are its NPCs. From 1978 to 2013, from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao, the CCP was focused on economic growth. But under Xi Jinping, it’s taken a turn towards militarist nationalism. It builds most of the world’s physical products, its military budget is already >1/3 that of America’s, it has a more focused task (“reunify China” rather than “police the world”), it produces military recruiting videos likeWe Will Always Be Here, and - most importantly - it is investing heavily in AI and drones. On that last point, China is just better at deployment in the physical world than the US government or military, as we can see from (a) thepublic infrastructurecomparison, (b) the multibillion dollar failures of the AmericanFord-class aircraft carrier, theF-35 manned aircraft, theLittoral Combat Ship, and theZumwalt destroyer, and (c) the fact that all the manufacturing know-how and the factories themselves are in China. Robotics could shift manufacturing out of China, but until then it is quite possible that the “arsenal of democracy” is more like the “arsenal of communism.”124 Note however that just because China becomesprimarilya martial power does not mean it will necessarily win a physical conflict. The Nazis too in our framework were primarily a martial power, and did not win. Then again, while the Nazis were outnumbered by the US/UK/USSR by a 5:1 ratio (70M to 350M), the Chinese outnumber the Americans by a roughly 4:1 ratio (1.4B to 330M), so past performance may not be predictive of future results. This one is almost too obvious, so we won’t belabor it. The global network of BTC holders in a key sense also standsabovestates, like the NYT network stands above the American state and the CCP network stands above the Chinese state. Why? Because it’s very hard for states toseize Bitcoin, in the absence of some kind of quantum computing breakthrough. But it’s primarily a money power rather than a moral power like NYT, or a martial power like CCP. The less-obvious point is that BTC — and its adjacent group of web3 users — are becoming amediapower that will eventually topple the NYT, much as the 20th century US’s media power eventually outcompeted that of the Soviet Union. Why? Decentralized media. You can see early signs of this with Substack, Mirror, and NFTs…but in brief, the best content creators have better things to do than work for the establishment. They can become publishers of their own, by founding their own media companies. As with the CCP’s transition to a martial power, the BTC/web3 transition to a moneyandmedia power is not at all conventional wisdom. Of course, these aren’t pure forms. NYT is a publicly traded multibillion dollar corporation, and is certainly able to influence the Fed and other huge flows of money. And it can spur much of the US military into action with a fake article or three. So it has money and martial power, even if it is primarily a moral power. CCP endlessly preaches to its citizens viaXuexi Qiangguo, and until recently was focused entirely on business. So it has a moral and money power as well, though it is becoming primarily a martial power. Finally, Bitcoin certainly makes a set of implicit moral arguments: inflation is bad, centralization is bad, pseudonymity is good, and the like. And it has a martial power, though it’s entirely defensive, as the combination of encryption and physical decentralization render it resistant to 20th-century-style military attacks. But it is, perhaps obviously, fundamentally a money power. One can do a similar exercise for the US/USSR/NSDAP triangle. Next Section: Submission, Sympathy, Sovereignty",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Each pole legitimizes themselves by appealing to a societally useful concept, and takes it to an extreme as part of denouncing its opposite extreme. The CCP is the most obvious: you must submit. They’re the Chinese Communist Party, and they’re powerful, so you must bow your head. This is very simple and straightforward and easy to understand, though it only really works for them within China and the Chinese internet. The NYT pole is slightly more subtle: they demand you mustsympathize. After all aren’t you white, or male, or straight, or cis, or abled, or wealthy, or a member of one of an ever-multiplying number of privileged categories — and therefore an oppressor onsomedimension? Becauseyou’repowerful, you must sympathize, and bow your head to those you have ostensibly oppressed. It’s a left-handed version of the submission ideology. It can get anyone to bow their head in the name of empowering them, because 99.99% of the world is an “oppressor” on at least some dimension. This pole is strongest on the English-speaking125internet, weakest on the Chinese internet, and of intermediate strength outside that. The BTC pole is the opposite of both of these. It demands you must besovereign. That means rather than bending to the CCP, or slitting your wrists as NYT demands, you hold your head up high. You hold your private keys locally, you don’t trust centralized corporations or governments, you’re self-sufficient and autarkic, you’re living off the grid. This pole is strong on the global internet, though it’s facing pushback from both CCP and NYT. The subtlety here is that each of these poles has an element of truth to it. You don’t want a CCP society where everyone has no recourse but to submit, because that can easily become a now-digital totalitarianism. On the other hand, you also don’t want a society where no one submits to anyone, because that looks like San Francisco, where people can run into Walgreens and steal everything. You don’t want the NYT-run society where everyone has no recourse but to sympathize with thecurrent thing, because that results in what Matt Yglesias has called theGreat Awokening: the emotive and irrational breakdowns that set America on fire and continue to roil US society. Yet you also don’t want the society whereno onesympathizes, because that looks like the Grand Theft Auto environment of1990s Russia, the low-trust post-communist society where any cooperative endeavor is regarded as a scam. Finally, and perhaps least obviously, you don’t want the society where everyonemustbe sovereign, because taken to its irrational126limit that means pumping your own water from out of the ground, growing your own food, not trusting any vendor or person other than yourself, and generally ending the division of labor that makes capitalism run. Extreme autarky might sound romantic, but in the absence of robotic breakthroughs going truly off-grid is a recipe for dramatic regression in the standard of living. Conversely, of course you don’t want a society where no one has the possibility of being sovereign at all, as this leaves us all subject to the not-so-incipient digital totalitarianism that CCP has already rolled out andNYTwishesit could. One might argue — and I would agree — that while these three poles and their opposite three extremes are bad, they are not allequallybad, and you don’t necessarily need to be dead center. For example, I’d personally err much closer to the sovereignty pole than our current culture, and try to develop the technologies to enable this. However, we should recognize that different strokes will suit different folks. And rather than trying to impose preferences on everyone, what we really want are avarietyof points in between these three undesirable poles: different fusions for different groups. The construction we outline in this book — the startup society that ultimately becomes a network state – ideally combines aspects of all three. For example, it does have a clear founder to provide direction, but it ensures every citizen has the right to freely leave should they choose, that coinholders also have a say, and a number of other digital checks and balances. This concept is the basis of the recentralized center, an idea we discuss in depth later. Next Section: Conflicts and Alliances",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/conflicts-and-alliances,"Title: Conflicts and Alliances
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. A tripolar triangle leads to surprisingly complicated dynamics. During the Great Depression, FDR’s US admired the Nazis and the NYT wrote encomiums to them, as documented inThree New DealsandThe Gray Lady Winked. Then, after theMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR and the Nazis kicked off World War 2 by invading Poland together, with the USSR standing by as the Nazis fought the Anglo-Americans, and the US-alignedUK seriously contemplating bombing the Soviets. Later, the USSR and the Nazis fought each other during Barbarossa. Then, the US and the USSR teamed up to fight the Nazis. Finally, the US and USSR split Germany between themselves and fought each other during the Cold War. That’s why Orwell wrote in 1984 about how “Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia”127— because the coalitions between states switched all the time. With networks rather than states, the coalitions are even more fluid, with several existing simultaneously. NYT vs CCP.This is the obvious one, the Thucydides trap, the Great Power conflict between the US and China that many have predicted. But there’s a subtlety here. Many regular Chinese people don’t want such a conflict, and many Americans don’t either, but those who are invested in imperial ambitions on both sides — the paper subscribers and the party members — are into it. Networks are driving the states to war. NYT vs BTC.This is another obvious one, the American regulatory state (which NYT is upstream of) against the decentralized network. We are seeing this push with efforts like the failed 2021 House Bill and the “concerned.tech” letter. Note the demographics of the signatories to the latter: it is almost entirely white Westerners complaining about the US establishment losing root control over the global financial system. It is doubtful that their enthusiasm for the dollar will be shared by Americans hit by inflation — or by people overseas. This conflict is the American establishment vs the Global Internet. CCP vs BTC.Yet another obvious one. The CCP has “banned” Bitcoin many times over the years, but those bans have materially grown in severity. The most recent action was just short of a seizure. NYT + CCP vs BTC.This is the State vs the Network. It’s when the NYT-controlled American empire and the CCP-controlled Chinese empire team up to attack BTC, perhaps on the grounds of “climate” or some other thinly veiled excuse to maintain state power. NYT + BTC vs CCP.This is Western voice and exit together vs Eastern control. It’s when NYT’s interests in disrupting the Chinese regime and BTC’s interests in providing globally uncensorable savings overlap to provide a thorn in the side for CCP. The web3 part of BTC/web3 becomes particularly important here, because it provides hard-to-censor global services that complement digital gold, which on its own is necessary but not sufficient for freedom. BTC + CCP vs NYT.This is the post-American world against the American empire. Against the inflating dollar, China and crypto together can do something neither can alone. The CCP/RMB pole runs a Chinese system that is already at scale, capable of operating completely outside the dollar, and based on a more modern digital yuan to boot. The BTC/web3 part of this aligns American dissidents128with global crypto holders, and promotes neutral protocols129that take away American root access (but also don’t grant it to China). Near each pole there is an internal dyad representing the conflictwithin. We represent this as an inscribed triangle within the tripolar triangle. Near the NYT pole are the American dissidents, the non-woke liberals, centrists, and conservatives who disagree with the US establishment’s platform of speech controls, inflation, and unending warfare - but still identify as American first, and don’t want to see China become number one. Near the CCP pole are the Chinese liberals, the internationalist capitalists who thought times were better under Hu, as well as the many groups left and right who’ve seen their fortunes dim under newly aggressive Chinese nationalism…but, again, who still see themselves as Chinese first, and don’t want to bend to American imperialism. Near the BTC pole is the web3 community and the tens of millions of Bitcoin holders who don’t identify as Maximalists…but who also still subscribe to many of the internationalist principles that presuppose an internet without AmericanorChinese root control over the financial or communication systems. And what about other countries and people who don’t define themselves with reference to the Americans, the Chinese, or the blockchain? Well, there will be a lot of pressure to identify with the first two poles…which will drive any group that doesn’t want to be under the thumb of the US establishment or the CCP to the third pole of BTC/web3. That is, one of our premises is that the Indians, Israelis, American dissidents, Chinese liberals, tech founders/investors, and people from other countries that want tomaintaintheir own sovereignty will need to avail themselves of BTC/web3 for decentralized communication, transaction, and computation. But to fully explain why, we’ll need to go through a scenario for the future that isn’t about remaining under the thumb of US or Chinese centralization, nor about falling into crypto-anarchic decentralization, but rather about consciously recentralizing into opt-in startup societies. Next Section: The Possible Futures",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/the-possible-futures,"Title: Decentralization, Recentralization
Content: Decentralization, RecentralizationChapter 4 Narrated by Balaji AI. It’s not aboutthefuture, it’s about thepossiblefutures. Why? Because causality exists. Because we can run controlled experiments. Because human action can influence outcomes. Because we aren’t communists that believe in the historical inevitability of utopian outcomes, but technologists that believe in individual initiative subject to practical constraints.130 The previous two chapters were about those constraints, about the past and the immediate present. They orient us to discuss several possible futures, before picking out one trajectory to focus on - the one where we materialize many startup societies, get a few diplomatically recognized as network states, and rebuild high-trust societies via arecentralizedcenter. Some caveats before we begin, though. When it comes to the past, every history is, inevitably, just a story.131That is, any tale of the past is necessarily abridged, abbreviated, edited, and idiosyncratic. You can’t convey 5000 years of written records any other way. And our tale ofHistory as Trajectoryis no different: it’s like the “why now” slide at the beginning of every entrepreneur’s deck, a practical history132of particular events that lead to the feasibility of the network state. But we cited our references, so you can check our facts. On the topic of the present, our chapter on theTripolar Momentis the section of the book that is likely to be the most dated. Intentionally so, because we endeavored to move most references to current or near-past events to this section.133So, think of that chapter as being very much a worldview circa mid-2022; like theKalman filter, we reserve the right to incorporatenew informationto update it. Now to the subject of the future. As you’ll see we do believe a recentralized center of pragmatic network statescanemerge, and describe several scenarios where this could happen. But our projections are just scenarios, and throughout we keep in mind volatility, reflexivity, competing curves, and the consequent limits to predictability. First,volatilityis rising because theinternet increases variance. Social media is social volatility (go viral or get canceled), and cryptocurrency is financial volatility (go to the moon or get rekt). Volatility makes correct predictions more difficult, but offers upside for those who predict correctly. And volatility is good for insurgents and bad for incumbents, because the former only need to get lucky once while the latter need to keep staying lucky. It’s no longer just individuals that are subject to high volatility, as entire countries can rise and fall overnight. So, in a high volatility environment, onlyBezos-style invariantsremain constant. All other observations should be taken as tentative — they are true until they are suddenly not. ReflexivityisSoros’ term for the feedback loop between participants’ understanding of a situation and the situation in which they participate. In systems made of human beings, putting something out into the world results in a reaction, and then a reaction to that reaction, and so on, often resulting in positive and negative feedback loops rather than textbook convergence to equilibria. Thus, when collecting data on such systems, let alone forecasting them, one must keep in mind that people willreactto predictions themselves, sometimes to make them come true. In social science, unlike physical science, every row in a dataset represents a human being with a mind of their own. The concept ofcompeting curvesrefers to the fact that there are many simultaneous technopolitical movements competing at the present moment, different phenomena rising from zero to affect millions over the course of years, months, or even days. For example, if you take a look atthis graph of how people met their spouses, you can see several different curves rising and falling as different cultural movements “come online,” until the internet just dominates everything. Another example is themarket share of social networks over time; a third is Ray Dalio’sgraph of the rise and fall of nations. The point is that you can identify the players, but not always the outcome, in a complex multiactor process. Applying this to our scenario analysis, we have some trends that are synergistic and others that are antagonistic. For example, many trendlines point to diminished American power, but at least one points in the other direction: the West’s willingness to weaponize its tech giants for domestic and foreign conflicts alike. Does this give American dominance another few years, another decade, or many more than that? We can identify the curves but not always which ones win out. Predictabilityhas its limits. In our view there are two kinds of predictions that matter: the physical and the financial. The physical prediction is a very specific bet on thetrajectory of a ball, on a genomicbase call, or on the electron configuration of anorbital. It’s checked by reproducible experiment, and your device fails if it fails. The financial prediction is at the opposite end of the spectrum: it’s a macroscopic bet on the volatile, reflexive behavior of other human beings. It’s checked by the unforgiving market, and yourfundfails if it fails. We aren’t as interested in betting on manipulation-prone government statistics. According to the Chinese government of 2021, the number of COVID deaths in China from mid 2020-2022 waszero. According to the San Francisco government of 2021, the crime rate in SF wasdeclining. According to the US establishment of 2021, the inflation of the dollar wastransitory. All this reminds us of the Soviet government of 1932, who said the harvest in Ukraine wasglorious. As we discuss later, itisuseful to create on-chainshadow statisticsthat are more verifiable, reliable, and censorship-resistant than these easily faked indicators. But outside of that, predictions on official government statistics are otherwise uninteresting because of how obviously political they are. So we steer clear of that kind of thing — in our analysis of possible futures, we’ll either predict something is technologically (and hence physically) feasible, or that it could result in a financial return, or both. And we’ll give recipes for how to make those predictions reality, or prevent them from becoming reality, in the form of fictional scenarios on good and bad futures. So, to recap: our history is just a story, our analysis of the present may presently be dated, and our forecasts for the future may be confounded by volatility, reflexivity, competing curves, and the limits of predictability. With that said,all models are wrong, but some are useful; so with caveats cataloged and provisos provided, let’s proceed! We start by describing new lenses to view the world in the sections onSociopoliticalandTechnoeconomicaxes. These are mental models that hopefully help compress large amounts of data into rough patterns. Next, in the section onForeseeable Futures, we put on our tech investor hats and project out into the near future, describing developments we anticipate. These aren’t just random investment theses, though; they’re pieces of the future that are relevant to startup societies and network states. We then game out one specific science fiction scenario in detail that we think is unfortunately quite plausible:American Anarchy, Chinese Control, and the International Intermediate. In this scenario, we project a Second American Civil War triggered in part by a broke US government that attempts Bitcoin seizures, a situation we call American Anarchy. Unlike the first Civil War, this would be a stochastic struggle between two Networks rather than an explicit dispute between two States. It would be more undeclared than declared, more invisible than legible. And this conflict could end in decentralization and disunion instead of centralization and consolidation. As radical as that sounds, many thinkers from across the political spectrum already foresee something like this happening in different ways, including Stephen Marche, David Reaboi, Barbara Walter, and Kurt Schlichter, though like me none of them are particularly happy about the prospect. Meanwhile, in this fictional scenario, the CCP implements an intense domestic crackdown on the other side of the world to maintain stability, preventing Chinese people from freely leaving the digital yuan network with their property, a result we refer to as Chinese Control. As America descends into anarchy, the CCP points to their functional-but-highly-unfree system as the only alternative, and exports a turnkey version of their surveillance state to other countries as the next version of Belt and Road, as a piece of “infrastructure” that comes complete with a SaaS subscription to China’s all-seeing AI eye. In the name of putting a lid on the anarchy and restoring “democracy”, the US establishment then silently copies CCP’s methodology without admitting they’re doing so, much as they cloned China’s lockdown after loudly denouncing it. Similarly, after spending a decade pretending to decry “surveillance capitalism”, the US establishment formally deputizes many Big Tech companies as official arms of the surveillance state. However, the establishment’s implementation of thisdigital lockdownis as tragicomic as the CCP’s version is totalitarian, and is porous enough to permit serious resistance. This is the world we could be barreling towards. You don’t have to believe in it to found a startup society, though. So why talk about it at all then? Because in a high volatility time, it’s worth thinking through models of how our future could be very different from our present.135 Think of the American-Anarchy-vs-Chinese-Control scenario as a strong form model of how NYT, BTC, and CCP could collide, with startup societies and network states arising out of that atom-smasher as deliberately created alternatives to Wokeness, Maximalism,andChinese Communism. The weak form model is that things don’t work out precisely this way (few things do!), but that the general trend is correct. That is, in the future the US Establishmentdoeslose relative control, the CCPdoestry to exert absolute control, and Bitcoin Maximalistsdoadvocate for no control. The way of life propounded by each of these ideological communities will get extreme, but will also be itself justified as areactionto the other two perceived extremes, as discussed inExtremes and Counter-Extremes Are Undesirable. So we’ll still need to build societies with consciously chosen tradeoffs between submission, sympathy, and sovereignty, instead of unconsciously capitulating to either an extreme or counter-extreme. And that again leads us to startup societies and network states. So, using the strong-form scenario as a base, we discuss a number ofVictory Conditions and Surprise Endingsfor different factions. We also give a bit more detail on the desired outcome, the trajectory we want to shoot for: aRecentralized Centerof high-trust societies. Our goal in thinking all this through is not pessimistic but pragmatic: to change what we can change, by setting up a fourth pole as an alternative to the failing US establishment, to maximalist crypto-anarchy,andto the centralized surveillance state of the CCP. We call the raw material for this fourth pole theInternational Intermediate. It includes American centrists, Chinese liberals, Indians, Israelis, web3 technologists, and essentially everyone from around the world that wants to avoid both the American and Chinese whirlpools. At first blush, this group represents ~80% of the world population and has little in common save their disinclination towards both anarchy and tyranny. But a subset of them will be smart enough to realize that exit is a stopgap, not a solution. People tend to imitate what they see, and if American Anarchy and Chinese Control are the most prominent games in town they will eventually be imitated. So isolationism is off the table. Yet so is direct intervention, as both the American and Chinese theaters will snarl against any outside interference. The answer then isinnovationrather than isolationism or interventionism. A subset of the International Intermediate needs to build something better than both American Anarchy and Chinese Control, a concrete improvement over the propaganda, coercion, surveillance, and conflict that may soon characterize the two pillars of the global economy. In other words, the rest of the world will need to lead. They can’t hope for the US establishment or CCP to figure it out. And that’s theRecentralized Center: a circle of startup societies and network states built by pragmatic founders, a group of high-trust communities architected as intentional alternatives to failed states and surveillance states alike.

https://thenetworkstate.com/sociopolitical-axes,"Title: Sociopolitical Axes
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Old mental models for understanding the world are quickly going out of date. Not only are things changing faster, things are changing faster onnew dimensions. New sociopolitical axes are emerging. Seeing the world through old lenses risks being caught blindsided by the political equivalent of a runaway truck. People who thought the financial crisis of 2008 wasunthinkablejust weren’t looking at the right graphs.Michael Burrywas, though. In the same spirit, what are some new graphs we could look at, new themes for conflict and cooperation, new sociopolitical axes that are underestimated? That’s what this section is about. I am moderately bullish on India, but extremely bullish on Indians. Why? Well, first let’s talk about India the country. If you’re in the West, haven’t been paying attention to India, and think it’s still just an uninteresting “Third World country,” you can be forgiven for that. But take a look at the following links to orient: Putting that all together, there are now significant chunks of the “ascending world” which arecleaner and better maintainedthan the “descending world” environments of Los Angeles and San Francisco. That doesn’t mean the curves are the same — just that they overlap in a way that would have been unthinkable a few decades ago. Next, let’s talk about the Indian diaspora. There are about five million people of Indian ancestry in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, and a fair bit more if we include the full South Asian diaspora. They have done quite well over the last few decades. While the first generation came over with portable technical skills in medicine and engineering, the second generation within the West speaks English without an accent and with full cultural fluency - resulting in many Indians in law, filmmaking, and media. Some have even ascended to the commanding heights of politics and technology, like Kamala Harris, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella. That sets up an interesting State-plus-Network dynamic. Using ourterminology, the IndianStatemay take one step back for every two steps forward, even though it’s been moving forward as of late. But theNetworkof the global Indian diaspora is just on an exponential rise. Indeed, I think the 2020s will be for the Indian Network what the 2010s were for the Chinese State - somewhat ignored at the beginning of the decade, but an important global force by the end of it. Recallthat“China had its first unicorn in 2010, and it took five years for it to get to five unicorns; the year after that, it had twenty. Ecosystems develop very slowly, and then all at once.” Please don’t think of this as Indian triumphalism at all – I actually find it surprising! It’s just recognition of an unexpected new player entering the arena that many still underappreciate. For further context, you might readA New Idea of IndiaorOur Time Has Come. An important emerging political axis is transhumanism versus anarcho-primitivism. Briefly, transhumanists think technology is good, and want to use technology to change humanity in fundamental ways. Conversely, anarcho-primitivists think technology is bad, and want to to return to the wild, de-industrialize, and abandon technology. They think of humans as pollution on this great Earth. There are right and left varieties of each, though they overlap. Left transhumanists like Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum to some extent give rise to right anarcho-primitivists, and vice versa. Basically, left transhumanists make changes to the human body that rightists find aesthetically unappealing. Conversely, right transhumanists advocate improvements to the human body that left anarcho-primitivists find terrifying. It works in reverse as well. Some anarcho-primitivists advocate a back-to-the-land kind of traditional masculinity that some transhumanists find constraining. And some anarcho-primitivists want a Unabomber-like end to industrial civilization which would (among other things!) destroy the supply chains needed for the life extension sought by transhumanists. An issue that confused me for a while is why criticism of San Francisco seemed to anger some people irrationally. Couldn’t they also see that prices and feces were both up and to the right at the same time? Eventually what I realized is that everyone is patriotic aboutsomething, and those people were patriotic about their city, while others were patriotic about their countries, companies, or even their cryptocurrencies. To elaborate on this point, for someone whoidentifiesthemselves as a San Franciscan, criticism of the city is taken personally, because that isn’t a swappable piece of their life. Their company? That’s just a job, it’s replaceable, what they really care about is the Golden Gate Bridge, the Presidio, the 49ers - a sort of romantic identification with the city itself, and many of the people that live there. Others affiliate with their national identity first, above their city identity - they’ll move between military bases at the drop of a hat, which are interchangeable, but they are willing to kill and die for the flag with which they identify. Or they might be “based” out of Seattle for a time, signifying that their location is immaterial, while signaling their deep love for democracy online, an identity that is non-negotiable. Still others are patriotic about their companies, those things they’ve founded and funded, breathed life into, those entities that took all their capital and intellect to build, which are always far more fragile than they look from the outside, and which some callous outsider could break for likes with a few morale-draining tweets. And yet others characterize themselves by their cryptocurrencies, thinking of themselves first and foremost as Bitcoiners or Ethereans. These folks are often digital nomads, indifferent as to whether they see the sunset in San Francisco or Singapore, or what crypto exchange lives or dies, so long as they can check in with their community of holders each day. In each case, there’s typically a large economic, social, or political stake in the thing people are identifying with. The city patriot may be a homeowner or otherwise invested in city governance. The country patriot may have signed a military contract. The company patriot may be a founder or early employee with a significant equity stake. And the cryptocurrency patriot is often a sizeable holder of coins. Now, not all things are like this; people can be right-handed without identifying themselves as right handers, they candosomething withoutbeingsomething. So top-level identity, primary identity - that’s precious, it’s rare, it’s the identity that supersedes all others. People might use seven daily apps but they have even fewer primary identities - usually only one. Primary identities need not just be about city, country, company, or cryptocurrency. They can be related to religion, ethnicity, or professions like “journalist” and “professor”. There’s a huge up-front sacrifice required to become a tenured professor, or to publicly convert to a new religion, and for this reason such primary identities often make it to the fore of someone’s Twitter bio. Here’s a concrete example of the identity stack, with three Twitter bios: Jim: #HereWeGo #SteelerNation 🏈 — All Things PA — Father — Husband — #Christian — #ArmyVet Billy: Immutable money, infinite frontier, eternal life. #Bitcoin Bob: Army retired, anti-terrorist assistance program, husband, father, grandfather, Iraq vet, educator, but most importantly an AMERICAN! Again, everybody is patriotic about something. Jim loves his city; Billy is patriotic about technology and transhumanism; Bob would fight for the American flag. The collection of all that defines someone, in rank order, is theiridentity stack. The top of the identity stack is the primary identity: the Pittsburgh Steelers for Jim, Bitcoin for Billy, and America for Bob. And, as noted, primary identity is precious. It’s the identity that supersedes all others. To build anything great – a company, a currency, a civilization – an affiliation must beat out the rest of the identity stack to become someone’s primary identity. That’s a high bar to meet. Next Section: Technoeconomic Axes",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/technoeconomic-axes,"Title: Technoeconomic Axes
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. The internet increases variance. Digitization allows situations to be taken to their logical conclusion, instantly, even when that digital logic doesn’t quite work in physical reality. This means things can flip from zero to one, without warning. An overnight success, ten seconds in the making. The only certainty is rising volatility. First, the observation: over the last 20 years, we’ve gone from 30 minute sitcoms to 30 second clips and 30 episode Netflix binges. From a stable 9-5 job to a gig economy task or a crypto windfall. From a standard life script to 30 year olds living with their parents and 20 year old startup CEOs. This is a very general phenomenon. You see it in the dashboard of every internet disruptor. With Uber, for example, relative to the time of a standard taxi ride, some Uber trips are much longer and others much shorter. Why is this happening? Because the internet connects people peer-to-peer. It disintermediates. In doing this it removes the middleman, the mediator, the moderator, and the mediocrity. Of course, each of those words has a different connotation. People are happy to see the middleman and mediocrity go, but they don’t necessarily want to see the moderator and mediator disappear. Nevertheless, at least at first, when the internet enters an arena, once the Network Leviathan rears its head, this is what happens. Nodes that had never met before, could never have met before, now connect peer-to-peer. They can form something terrible like a Twitter mob, or they can form something amazing like ETH Research. You get extreme downside and extreme upside.136 One analogy is to acentrifuge. If you take a sample of biological fluid from your body and centrifuge it, you’ll see a bunch of layers that were previously mixed together. Then they all get separated out. That’s what the internet is doing to society, to institutions. It’s just centrifuging it into its constituent parts, whether that be albums separated into songs or newspapers disaggregated into articles. That’s the unbundling. Then comes the rebundling. The songs get grouped into playlists, the articles grouped into Twitter feeds. This step too is profitable; it’s not the same as what came before, it’s a v3, it’s a flexible bundle. It’s the helical theory of history, where from one standpoint we’ve come full circle (“rebundling into an album-like playlist”) but from another axis we’ve made amazing progress (“anyone can play any individual song and create whatever playlist they want”). With that said, that rebundling is still higher variance than the pre-internet bundles that preceded them. There are millions more playlists than albums, millions more Twitter feeds than newspapers. As the internet increases variance, we see more upside and more downside in everything. Technologists focus on the upside, because the gain from the wins (like search engines, smartphones, social networks, and artificial intelligence) should compound while the losses should be one-offs. That is, once you find a winning formula, or a rebundling, you can cheaply scale it across the rest of the network relatively quickly. So, this probably should lead to morenetupside over time, just like every past technological revolution has. I think we’re already way in the black with the internet (almost every piece of information ever in billions of people’s hands for free at any time, for starters), but it depends on your metric. Conversely, the establishment can only see the downside outcomes. That is, the BlueAnons can only see the QAnons who are worse than median, not the SatoshiAnons who are far better than median. It’s a bit like Paul Graham’s concept of the Blub programmer. Just like the Blub programmer can look down to see incompetence, but can’t look up to see brilliance, the establishmentarian can’t comprehend the upwards deviations of the internet. They think it’s just weird. Just like Hollywood once compared Netflix to the Albanian Army, the US establishment doesn’t yet understand how much better Satoshi Nakamoto or Vitalik Buterin is than every apparatchik they have in the Federal Reserve system. And they don’t understand that upward deviation is creating a more competent group of global leaders than the American establishment, a more meritocratically selected group than the nepotists of the East Coast. Just as it allowed Satoshi to rise. There are two particular ways that the internet increases variance worth noting: social media and digital currency. Social media increasessocial volatility. You can go viral or get canceled, experiencing large overnight gains137or losses in status. Digital currency increasesfinancial volatility. You can go to the moon or “get rekt,” experiencing large overnight gains or losses in financial status. There’s a parallel in history for this: glasnost and perestroika. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, thought he could reform Soviet society by allowing more free speech (via glasnost) and free markets (via perestroika). He didn’t quite understand what he was in for. The resultant instability helped bring down the Soviet Union. Similarly, social media is like American glasnost and cryptocurrency is American perestroika. Just as Gorbachev unleashed free speech and free market reforms because he believed communism could be reformed, the US establishment actually bought their own narrative in the 1990s and 2000s about their ostensibly free and democratic society. Only now are they realizing that the many speech and thought controls that their predecessors had set up and hidden in plain sight - like stringent regulations and high capital requirements for broadcast content production - was actually the key to their continued power. Now that it’s clear that the Internet is to the USA what the USA was to the USSR, that it’s truly free speech and free markets, they are trying to tamp down theAmerican Springthey’ve unleashed, but it may be too late. Obama was in a sense arguably America’s Gorbachev, as he allowed technology to grow mostly unimpeded from 2008-2016, to billions of users, without fully realizing what would ensue. Few institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet. Why? Because the internet increases variance, it causes huge surges of digital pressure on older institutions that just weren’t built for it. They can’t handle the peak levels of social and financial stress that the internet can unleash. They’re like seaside towns that weren’t built for a thousand year flood. Michael Solana’s postJUMPis quite good on this topic. Indeed, this is a good analogy, because one of the ways to think about the internet is as a carrier of massiveinformation waves. Most normal waves propagate in physical space –– the standard partial differential equations (PDEs) are 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional (e.g. longitudinal waves like a slinky, transverse like electromagnetic waves, or earthquake-style spherical waves). But theseinformation wavespropagate on highly dynamic social networks where the topology138of connection & disconnection changes quite a bit. The digital is primary and the physical is now secondary. The digital transition happens in three phases: there’s the physical version, the intermediate form, and then the internet-native version. If you’re into electrical engineering, you can think of this as analog, to analog/digital, to natively digital. One example is the transition from a piece of paper, to a scanner which scans that file into a digital version, to a natively digital text file which begins life on the computer and is only printed out when it needs to be. Another example is the transition from face-to-face meetings, to Zoom video (which is a scanner of faces), to natively digital VR meetings. Yet another example: physical cash, to something like PayPal or fintech (which is just a scan of the pre-existing banking system), to the truly native digital version of money: cryptocurrency. Once you see this pattern you can see it everywhere, and you can look for those spaces where we’re still stuck at the v2, at the scanned version, where we’ve taken the offline experience and put it online, but not fundamentally innovated. Newspapers are actually only partially digitized. In 1996, the primary version of The New York Times was the physical paper and the mirror was the website. Then, gradually, more and more weight got shifted to the digital version. Now it can fairly be said that the physical paper is just a printout of the website, a snapshot at a particular time. And there are online-only features like interactive graphics that are impossible to replicate in the physical paper. Most importantly, the comments section is really social media, particularly Twitter, where all the reporters are located. But this is still really just a newspaper, put online. Most of itcanbe printed out. What’s the next step in this evolution? What does natively digital news look like? There are at least two concepts of interest here: morning dashboards replacing the morning newspaper, and cryptographically verifiable event feeds replacing tweets of unverifiable content. Dashboards > newspapers.If you are in tech, the first thing you look at each day may be a personal or company dashboard, like your fitbit or your sales. This isgood. The first thing you look at each day shouldn’t be random stories someone else picked. Should be carefully selected metrics you want to improve. This is a good vector of attack to definitionally disrupt newspapers. If we think about it from Clayton Christensen’s “jobs to be done” perspective, newspapers have this incredible pride-of-place — first thing you look at in the morning! — but typically do not add enough value to deserve that position. On-chain event feeds > Twitter > newspapers.One key observation is that just as many sports articles are digest of box scores, and many financial articles are summaries of the day’s stock action, so too are many political and tech articles merely wrappers around tweets. Because news breaks on Twitter. So, eventually, the next kind of newspaper will look something like a cryptographically verified version of Twitter. The first draft of history will be the raw on-chain event feed, written directly to the ledger of record by billions of writers and sensors around the world. In other words, truly digital newspapers will be on-chain event feeds. Digitally signed crypto oracles, not corporations. My friend Daniel Gross remarked that 2020 will be seen by future historians as the year when the internet age truly began. The lasting impact of COVID-19 is that it flipped the world from physical to digital first. Because the internet in 2000 or 2010 couldn’t bear the load of the entire physical world. But by 2020, it kind of could. Now it’s not just about remote work, but remote life. During the pandemic, every sector that had previously been socially resistant to the internet (healthcare, education, law, finance, government itself) capitulated. Those aspects of society that had been very gradually changing with technology shifted overnight. For example, the convention of politeness shifted: now it was rude to ask for an in-person business meeting, as you’d do it remote if at all possible. With vaccination, many of these things have flipped back, but they won’t come back all the way. Digitization was permanently accelerated. It used to be that the physical world was primary, and the internet was the mirror. Now that has flipped. The digital world is primary and the physical world is just the mirror. We’re still physical beings, of course. But important events happen on the internet first and then materialize in the physical world later, if ever. All value eventually becomes digital, because we are generalizing the concept of “printing” from inking a piece of paper to actually materializing digital things in the physical world. This is counterintuitive, and you’ll have objections. But let’s get there in a few steps. So, if you put all that together, all value is digital. Everything starts on the computer, generates cryptocurrency, and can be used either to buy digital goods or to pay robots to materialize things in the physical world. Humans will still exist, of course, but the economy will become the cryptoeconomy. All value goes digital. What is theproductivity mystery? Well, we really should be in the middle of a golden age of productivity. Within living memory, computers did not exist. Photocopiers did not exist. Even backspace did not exist. You had to type it all by hand. It wasn’t that long ago that you couldn’t search all your documents, sort them, back them up, look things up, copy/paste things, email things, change fonts of things, or undo things. Instead, you had to type it all on a typewriter! If you’re doing information work, relative to your ancestors who worked with papyrus, paper, or typewriter, you are a golden god surfing on a sea of electrons. You can make things happen in seconds that would have taken them weeks, if they could do them at all. We should also be far more productive in the physical world. After all, our predecessors built railroads, skyscrapers, airplanes, and automobiles without computers or the internet. And built themfast. Using just typewriters, slide rules, & safety margins. This is a corollary to the Thiel/Cowen/Hall concept of the Great Stagnation. Where has all that extra productivity gone? It doesn’t appear manifest in the physical world, for sure, though you can argue it is there in the internet world. There are a few possible theses. The Great Distraction.All the productivity we gained has been frittered away on equal-and-opposite distractions like social media and games. The Great Dissipation.The productivity has been dissipated on things like forms, compliance, and process. The Great Divergence.The productivity is here, it’s just only harnessed by the indistractable few. The founders of tech unicorns, for example, may have more ability to focus online than most. The Great Dilemma.The productivity has been burned in bizarre ways that require line-by-line “profiling” of everything, like thistunnel study. The Great Dumbness.The productivity is here, but we’ve just made dumb decisions in the West while others have harnessed it. See for example China building a train station innine hoursvs taking 100-1000X139that long to upgrade a Caltrain stop. Now, yes, I’m sure not every train station in China is built in nine hours, and wouldn’t be surprised if some regions in the US (or the West more broadly) do better than SFBA. But feels likely that a systematic study would find a qualitative speed gap, 10-100X or more. The Great Delay.The productivity will be here, but is delayed till the arrival of robotics. That is, for things we can do completely on the computer, productivity has measurably accelerated. It is 100X faster to email something than to mail it. But a slow human still needs to act on it. So, in this hypothesis, humans are now the limiting factor. Essentially, representing a complex project on disk in something like Google Docs may not be the productivity win we think it is. Humans still need to comprehend all those electronic documents to build the thing in real life. So the problem may be in the analog/digital interface. Do we need to actuate as fast as we compute? That would mean zero-delay robotic task completion will be the true productivity unlock. And that we haven’t gone full digital yet. So long as humans are still in the loop, we won’t get the full benefits of digital productivity. I don’t know the answer, but I think the line-by-line profiling approach used on the tunnels is a good but slow way to find out exactly what went wrong, while the approach of looking at other countries and time periods – namely, studying history – could actually be the fast way of figuring out what might be right. If the organic borders of the physical world are rivers and mountain ranges, the organic borders of the internet are software incompatibilities and language barriers. The first of these is obvious: Facebook’s ecosystem is distinct from Google’s is distinct from Ethereum’s, because the backends don’t fully overlap, because they’re incompatible at the software level. The second is a bit less obvious. You can imagine the internet being cut up into continental-scale pieces, with the English-language internet being the largest with billions of people, the Chinese-language internet being the second largest with 1.3 billion, and so on for the Spanish-language, Japanese-language, Korean-language, Russian-language internets. One huge difference between the English internet and Chinese internet is that the former is global and arguably decentralized while the latter is heavily concentrated in China with the CCP maintaining root control over most key nodes. Another important consequence is that the English internet is about to admit a billion new users in the form of all the Indians who are newly coming online. And because the Indian internet becomes a much bigger part of the English-language discourse, it will be difficult for the US establishment to censor the English-language internet as much as they want to, because hosting can be based in the sovereign country of India. A network defect is when increasing the size beyond a certain point decreases the value of the network. Metcalfe’s law doesn’t include this dynamic as utility is projected to just increase to infinity as network size grows, but there are a few different mathematical models that predict this outcome, such as congestion-based models orthis postby Vitalik. Repulsion within a network is a key dynamic that can lead to network defect. The idea is that two or more subgroups within a network have such conflict that it reduces the global value of the network for both, until one of them defects to another network. So it’s a network “defect” in both senses of the term: a failure and a political defection. Next Section: Foreseeable Futures",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Augmented reality (AR) glasses may be the most foreseeable invention of all time. In the 90s and 2000s, people talked about theconvergence device. Gates imagined it would be a smart television, but it turned out to be the iPhone. What’s the next convergence device? I think it’s AR glasses. Take the following technologies: If you put all those together, you get a vision of augmented reality glasses that give you instant-on access to the digital world in your field of view, and perhaps darken with another touch to give youvirtualreality. Anyone can teleport into or out of your field of vision with your consent, you can “right click” on any object to get AI-informed metadata on it, and you can get computer-guided instructions to execute almost any physical procedure from repairing a machine to sewing. We know that millions of people manage to wear glasses all day, and they’re lighter than headsets and easy to take on and off. So these may become as ubiquitous as phones. It will be an engineering marvel to get there, of course, and while Apple is a strong contender Facebook may be the most likely company to be able to ship them given its progress with Oculus and founder-led innovation. Why will AR glasses be so big? If you think about how much of your life is spent looking at a screen, whether it’s a laptop or a phone or a watch, >50% of your waking hours is already spent in the matrix. AR glasses would reduce “screen” time in one sense, freeing you up to compute on the go without looking at a screen per se, but increase digital time in another sense, as people would constantly have these HUDs active to see the world. This means even more of our daily experience will blend not just the physical world dominated by natural law, but the digital world run by human-written code. The offline world still exists, physics and biology still exist, but algorithms and databases run even more of human existence. The Network surrounds us to an even greater extent than the State did. If combined with some kind of gesture interface (gloves, rings, or perhaps just sophisticated motion tracking), you might be able to use your hands to do anything in the digital realm. So, with AR glasses, the digital and physical realms fully blend, and people would actually be able to see and interact with an open metaverse in real life. Cryptoeconomics is transforming macroeconomics into an experimental subject. Why? Because you can actually issue a currency, set a monetary policy, get opt-in participants, and test your theories in practice. The proof is in the pudding. And, if successful, the pudding is worth many billions of dollars. This refutes the premise that economics and business are wholly disjoint. They aren’t disjoint at all. Microeconomics is the theory of individuals and firms, which is directly related to running a business. Each price you set, each company you start, is a kind of microeconomic experiment (albeit usually a poorly-controlled one). Macroeconomics, by contrast, until recently was off-limits to experiment. A first step forward was MIT’s Edward Castronova early work onvirtual economieslike World of Warcraft. Now anyone can create a cryptocurrency, set monetary policy, and see what happens. Perhaps the closest thing to experimental macroeconomics prior to cryptocurrency was the experience of setting up & scaling massive two-sided marketplaces like Airbnb, eBay, Google Ads, etc. You quickly learn that ideology is a poor guide. Naive libertarianism and progressivism both fail. Why? Basically, people want to make money on those platforms. They absolutely do respond to incentives, unlike the naive progressive model that it’ll all be altruistic behavior. But the marketplace operator has immense power to shape incentives for good or ill. So the naive libertarian belief in a fully decentralized Hayekian order does not always come about. Next Section: American Anarchy, Chinese Control, International Intermediate",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Here we give a bit more detail on a sci-fi scenario140in which the US descends into a chaotic Second American Civil War, the CCP responds with the opposite extreme of a total surveillance state that traps wealth in its digital yuan network, and the rest of the world - if we’re lucky - builds a stable alternative of opt-in startup societies that peacefully rejects these extremes. To be clear, you don’t need to believe in this scenario to build startup societies and network states. But it’s a mental model for the future, which we present for the same reason that Ray Dalio put out a (somewhat euphemistic) model of how the US order could fall to an external competitor, and Peter Turchin put out a (less euphemistic) model of how the US could fall into internal disorder. The progressive vision is that the West is getting more free, equal, and prosperous.141The dystopian vision is that we’re actually in the incipient stages of tyranny, whether that be fascist or woke respectively. What’s under-theorized is a third possibility: namely that, in the US at least, the inconclusive power struggle between Democrats and Republicans means America is headed foranarchy. As the events of 2021 unfolded, it became clear that even with unified control of the federal government, the Democrats were no more effective than the Republicans had been withcomparable powerfour years earlier. Neither faction proved capable of implementing the total top-down domination that some in their party advocated and many in the other party feared. Meanwhile, the non-partisan state-capacity of the US as a whole continued to visibly decay. Squint past the pandemic’s half-ignored, TSA-like COVID regulations and you saw a half-ignored, TSA-like COVID regulator – namely, a failing state that people did half-ignore, and arguably had to half-ignore, because the USA itself was now the TSA, and the TSA, they knew, was safety theater. Today, in the territory governed by this inept bureaucracy, we now see power outages, supply-chain shortages, rampant flooding, and uncontrolled fires. We see riots, arsons, shootings, stabbings, robberies, and murders. We see digital mobs that become physical mobs. We see a complete loss of trust in institutions from the state to the media. We see anti-capitalism and anti-rationalism. We see states breaking away from the US federal government, at home and abroad. And we see the End of Power, the Revolt of the Public, the defeat of the military, the inflation of the dollar, and - looming ahead - an American anarchy. What’s coming isn’t fascism or communism, like the left-wing and right-wing pundits would have us believe, even though they don’t believe it themselves. What’s coming is the exact opposite of that, a world where the civilized concepts of freedom and equity are extrapolated to their decivilizational limit, where you ain’t the boss of me and we are all equal, where all hierarchy is illegitimate and with it all authority, where no one is in charge and everything is in chaos. We can argue this may be preferable to the status quo, in the same way some think the chaotic Russia of the 1990s was on balance better than the authoritarian Soviet Union of the 1980s. We can argue it may be inevitable; as the Chinese proverb goes, “the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.” And we can argue that this transitional period of anarchy may be lamentable, but that it’s better than the other team being in charge, and that we can build a better order on the other side. Maybe so, and that’s what this book is about. But prior to any rebundling, I think we’re on track for quite the unbundling. With that poetic introduction over, let’s get down to specifics. Rather than seeing an indefinite continuation of the postwar order, or the long Second Cold War between the US and China that many are preparing for, the US may be on track to descend into an American Anarchy, a chaotic Second American Civil War between the US Establishment and its people. We foresee two main factions. The first will align around the US federal government, NYT/establishment media, wokeness, the dollar, and the Democrat party; they’ll say they’re fighting for “democracy” against “insurrectionists.” The second will align around state governments, decentralized media, maximalism, Bitcoin, and the Republican party; they’ll say they’re fighting for “freedom” against fiat “tyranny.” We can’t predict their names, but rather than Democrat Blue and Republican Red, let’s call them Wokes and Maximalists, or (more neutrally) Dollar Green and Bitcoin Orange. Crucially, in this scenario, many non-whites will switch sides from Democrat Blue to Bitcoin Orange, because whether black, white, Latino, or Asian, everyone’s savings will be crushed by inflation. Many tech founders and independent writers will also go Orange; tools like Square Cash will facilitate mass exodus to Bitcoin, and newsletter writers will put out narratives that contest establishment media. Conversely, many institutional loyalists will flip from Republican Red to Dollar Green, including the police, military, and neoconservatives, simply because they are in the final analysis the kind of team players and “natural conservatives” who would have fought for both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union. My country, right or wrong. The role of centralized tech companies will be key. By default they’ll swing to the Dollar Green side, but many tech founders will lean Bitcoin Orange, so we could see centralized tech companies supporting both sides — with older and fully wokified firms like Google firmly on the Green side, and newer founder-controlled firms located in places like Miami and Texas trending Orange. How could something as radical as a Second American Civil War happen? You could write a book on this, and several people have, but in lieu of that we’ll give a bullet pointed list. Before reviewing it, you might want to re-read Ray Dalio, Peter Turchin, and Strauss & Howe if you want more context, as we won’t be able to recapitulate every citation that informs this projection. Done? OK, here we go. Political polarization is way up.All the graphsshow this now. The US is not really a “nation state” any more, but a binational country comprised of two warring ethnic groups that disagree on fundamental moral premises. It is about “god, gays, and guns”, but it’s also also about censorship, surveillance, and inflation. State capacity is way down.The competent America of mid-century, the left/right fusion that FDR put together, the America that combined a powerful centralized state with social conservatism, the America depicted incountless movies, the America that won World War Two and the Cold War — that country is over. This US government can’t build abathroomin San Francisco, let alone a cost-effectivefighter jet,destroyer,combat ship, oraircraft carrier. Economic prosperity is declining.All the political infighting of the last decade happened during a period of relative prosperity, even if it was based on the artificial expedient of printing money. But now that we face potentially years of inflation and stagnation, unhappiness will increase. Already you’re seeing articles coming trying to acclimatize people to lower standards of living, to “eat bugs and live in a pod.” And Turchin’scliodynamicalgraphsput numbers to these feelings. Envy is increasing.This is normally phrased in terms of “inequality”, and that is indeed one way to look at it, but let’s rotate it by a few degrees and talk aboutenvy. The return of great fortunes, the rise of social media, and the decline in religion has led to escalating envy. Every day, people can see others online who appear to be better off than they are, and who appear to be rising while they are falling. Whether that rise is real or not, whether it is due to the other person’s own efforts or not – it doesn’t really matter to the person who feels they aren’t getting ahead, who feels they are falling behind. Without a rising tide that lifts all boats, the “rational” act for some is to sink the other boats, to pull escaping crabs down into the bucket. Why? Because misery loves company, and because stopping someone from getting too far ahead means they can’t outcompete you for houses or mates. The only way out of this negative-sum trap is to build provably positive-sum systems and high-trust societies. But that’s exactly what the US establishment is not doing.142It’s fomenting hatred on social media every day, and giving new reasons not to trust it — whether that be the insistent assurance that inflation istransitoryor all the other episodes ofofficial misinformation. Foreign military defeat looms.Leaving aside your feelings about the pandemic, the military propaganda beforehand is worth reviewing. In 2018, the US Department of Defense put outpress releaseson its preparation for a pandemic, on its sophisticated vaccines…and then nothing happened. This was the first time many in the public had the opportunity to directly compare statements about “secret military programs” to the actual results, just as you might compare projections by corporate executives to the actual results. And the size of that gap was remarkable. It indicated that at least some of the US military was just words, and not real. I remarked on this inearly 2021, months before the defeat in Afghanistan gave yet another example of the gap between US military rhetoric and reality, whereKabul wasn’t going to fallin a few days and then it did. As of this writing, we’re four months into the Russo-Ukrainian war of 2022. After an initial surge of attention, global interest in the conflict has dropped off a cliff. The New York Times and other establishment media outlets have now instructed the US administration to pursue peace, and various reports indicate that the Ukrainians are quickly plowing through ammunition stockpiles while the Russians are gaining ground with long-range artillery. To be clear, it’s not at all obvious what will happen - there’s fog of war with everything - but in the event of an outright Russian victory, defined as gaining territory they didn’t have prior to the war, that wouldn’t augur well for the US establishment. US states are pulling away from the feds.There’s enormous coverage of US politics at the national level, because it attracts clicks from all over. But local politics doesn’t get the same attention. However, if you’ve been paying attention, therehasbeen a multi-decadal trend whereinstates have been pulling awayfrom the federal government and each other on matters like guns, immigration, abortion, gambling, marijuana, and other matters. This is part of theFuture is Our Pastthesis: it’s reversing the de facto 10th Amendment repeal by FDR’s government, and more broadly is part of the gradual Western decentralization since the peak centralization of 1950. Authority has lost respect.The old American left said something like “we all need to work for the common good” while the old right said something like “pay your dues and you’ll achieve the American dream.” The new left says “we are all equal” and the new right says “you ain’t the boss of me.” So, the old left/right combination supported self-sacrifice and a stable hierarchy143, while the new one attacks all hierarchy as fundamentally illegitimate, as oppressive or tyrannical. This is reflected in the defacement and degradation of virtually every US institution over the last few decades, from the office of the presidency to the statues of American founders.George Washingtonand theUS Capitolare no longer sacred. National divorce is discussed.Secession is now officially part of the platform for Texas’ Republicans. And there have been an increasing number of pieces on the topic of “national divorce” from Democrats and Republicans alike, including NYMag (“No, We Can’t Get a National Divorce”), Stephen Marche (The Next Civil War), Barbara Walter (How Civil Wars Start), Michael Malice (“The Case for American Secession”), David Reaboi (“National Divorce Is Expensive, But It’s Worth Every Penny”), and the American Mind (“The Separation”). Radicalized movements reject the status quo.There have been countless words written on wokeness, on how it’s a radical ideology that thinks of the US as intrinsically corrupt — as systemically x-ist for many values of x — and therefore doesn’t really seek to reform America so much as to capture the state to completely transform it. SeeWesley Yang,Richard Hanania,Matthew Yglesias,John McWhorter,Bari Weiss, and many others for discussion of different aspects of this. The thing about wokeness is that it’s not just a superficial weed growing out of the topsoil. It has a root system, a theory of history and ethics that’s built on thousands of papers, on generations of academic humanists, on Foucault and Derrida and the like, on deconstruction and critical race theory and so on. I happen to think of it as a mostly evil doctrine, as sophisticated evil promoted in the name of good, but I recognize it has ideological content. The Republican party isn’t really capable of dealing with that. But Bitcoin Maximalism is. If you haven’t heard of it, you will. Bitcoin Maximalism is by far the most important ideology in the world that many people haven’t heard of - yet. There’s philosophical depth to Maximalism. It represents a root-and-branch rejection of the inflation that powers the US government and thus pays for everything. It fuses the worldview of Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and Ron Paul with Bitcoin. It naturally aligns with the loss of trust in institutions, with the suspicious individual who (understandably!) no longer trusts the federal government or US institutions on anything. It’s not merely an edit to the state, it’s the end of the state. And it’s a push from an ideological direction the Wokes are ill-prepared for, because it’s an aracial ultra-libertarianism rather than the white nationalism that folks like Marche and Walterthinkwill be their foe. If you want to understand Bitcoin Maximalism, readThe Bitcoin Standardor the tweets from accounts athive.one/bitcoin(not all are Maximalists). But be aware: just like wokes who reject “civility” on ideological grounds, maximalists have developed verbal justifications for being “toxic.” I disagree with the fundamental moral premise of Maximalism, which is that Bitcoin is the only coin and all other digital assets are sins.144I don’t believe in one coin anymore than I believe in one state or one god. But I understand the power that such a belief system has. Americans don’t believe in one god anymore, don’t believe in monotheism. So their choice is between one state and one coin, between ideological monostatism and mononumism. That is, to beat something like the US establishment in a civil conflict, you don’t just need bravery, you need a more powerful Schelling Point. That’s what Bitcoin is for the Maximalists: the one coin that’s the alternative to the one state. If and when the dollar collapses due to inflation, the orange coin becomes the new blue jeans, the global symbol of freedom and prosperity. (And what’s the alternative tothatalternative? Many network states as alternative to one nation state, many coins as alternatives to the one coin, many beliefs as the alternative to one belief system. That’s the polystatist, polynumist, polytheist model we describe later on in theRecentralized Center.) Bitcoin seizure could be the trigger event.All of this is a combustible mix, and there are many possible trigger events, but one that I see as particularly likely is a combination of (a) ruinous inflation followed by (b) a soaring BTC/USD price and then (c) the attempt by an insolvent federal government to seize Bitcoin from citizens. On the Bitcoin side, this isn’t a short-term price prediction or anything, and there are of course various possible failure modes145for BTC that could prevent Bitcoin from being the specific cryptocurrency that drives this scenario. Nevertheless, because the Bitcoin protocol has mostly been technologically fixed for a while, its partisans have focused to a much greater extent on political innovation – like getting it recognized as a sovereign currency. Add in the moral importance that Maximalists attach to Bitcoin, and its global name recognition, and BTC is likely to be the coin of contention. On the other side, the general concept of asset seizure isn’t really even very sci-fi given the overnight freezing of funds for Canadian truckers and 145M Russian nationals. The main difference is that cryptocurrency is built to be hard to freeze. A bankrupt state can and will try to seize funds held at centralized exchanges, but for those that have taken their funds off exchanges, the state will need to go house-to-house, andrubber hoses don’t scale. A US establishment attempt to seize Bitcoin in a time of high inflation would be like a repeat of FDR’s gold seizure (Executive Order 6102), except it’d be done during a time ofdecliningstate capacity rather than rising centralization. The reason something like this could be the trigger event is that neither side could easily back down: Wokes would have no power if their state went bankrupt, and Maximalists would have no money if they surrendered to the state. Thus, this seems like a relatively foreseeable event that could kick off the Second American Civil War — especially if the seizure bill is passed by the federal government and some states refuse to enforce it. How could that happen? A state-level refusal to enforce might just be part of thegrowing divergencebetween states from the federal government and each other, similar to the justification for sanctuary cities and the like. But if you wanted a statutory rationale, you could imagine a Constitutional Amendment proposed to ban Bitcoin seizure, something that would put the right to hold BTC on par with the right to free speech andthe right to bear arms. Such an amendment could be ratified by many states in the run up to a possible seizure bill. Even if it didn’t pass nationally, any ratifying states would then cite their ratification to justify their refusal to enforce. It’s a mistake to think a Second American Civil War would look anything like the first Civil War, or like World War 2 for that matter. It’d be nothing like the movies with huge movements of uniformed soldiers, tanks, and planes. Instead it’ll just be a continuation and escalation of what we’ve seen over the last several years: a network-to-network war to control minds, rather than state-to-state war to control territory. A fusion of America’s domestic conflicts on social networks and its foreign conflicts in the Middle East. The best way to visualize this is to look at the physical map of Union-vs-Confederate right before the Civil War, thephysical mapof Republican-vs-Democrat by county, and then thedigital mapof Republican-vs-Democrat in the same period. In the first Civil War, ideology and geography strongly coincided. The victory condition for the North was obvious: invade the South. Conquer the territory to conquer the minds. They didn’t have to kill every last Confederate, they just had to show that resistance was futile to get the remaining Confederates to stop fighting. In any second Civil War, ideology and geography would only weakly coincide. Look again at that map by county. Is one side really going to invade the other? Or vice versa? Is the US establishment going to seize corn fields or will its opponents move to capture big blocks of cities? Is either side going to use huge bombs on territories where they’d kill at least 30% of their own team? Could nuclear weapons be targeted enough to use as political tools to get the other side to concede? No. Instead it’ll be a war for minds, not lands. And if we look at the map of digital space, suddenly much becomes clear. Here, the two sides are fully separated, as the Union and Confederacy were. And now we can see why there’s been such an emphasis on cancellation, deplatforming, silencing, and shunning…on making people say certain words and hoist certain symbols. Because making a person or a company post a particular hashtag indicatescontrol of mindswhich is in turncontrol of digital territory. All the discussion over the last few years around “free speech” doesn’t really engage the fundamental issue, which is that this is a time of information war, where the victory condition for one side is to invade the minds of the other side – because it cannot feasibly invade the territory. To invade the minds of the other side, and to control the digital networks – because the tech companies that greenlight transactions, communications, and online behavior have in many ways become the de facto privatized governments of the Western world. The power to determine what people can and cannot do in the digital world belongs to the people who run these networks. And so controlling these networks, by controlling the minds of people who run them, is the key to maintaining control over the US in a digital time. That’s why there’s been such a push by the US establishment to wokify the big tech companies. However, a network that can’t be controlled in this way, and that isn’t run by any one person – like Bitcoin – well, that’s a form of resistance. The set of web3 networks that are more decentralized146than centralized Silicon Valley tech companies, that are run by communities – those too are a form of resistance. As such, if the first Civil War was the “War Between the States”, the second Civil War will be the “War Between the Networks.” The graphs we’ve shown relate to Red-vs-Blue, but add a tint of yellow to each group and rotate it a bit. Then you’ll get what we think is the likely future axis of conflict, which is Bitcoin-Orange-vs-Dollar-Green. In areas where Greens control the state, they may use militarized police, tech company surveillance, deplatforming, denunciation in media, arrests, seizures, and the like. In those areas, Orange may respond with an insurgency campaign that looks like Northern Ireland or the Middle East. But in areas where Oranges control the state, and Greens are in the minority, these tactics could reverse. Think about the BLM riots, or Jan 6, or the doxxing of Supreme Court Justices by angry establishmentarians, or the various street fights between right and left, or the constant digital struggle that plays out online every day, and project out a future where those kind of network warfare tactics become daily occurrences. Like the portmanteau “lawfare”, think of this as “netwar.” The reason the terms “left” and “right” don’t exactly fit for the projected conflict of Orange vs Green is that in many respects the Bitcoin Orange would be therevolutionary classfaction and the Dollar Greens would be theruling classfaction.147 Basically, those who side with the US establishment in this scenario would be the same personality type as those who sided with the ancien regime during the French Revolution: they’d be fighting to preserve the past. Their message would be one of particularism, of American nationalism, of continued dollar supremacy. By contrast, those who side with Bitcoin Maximalism would be a revolutionary personality fighting to overturn what they saw as tyranny. Their message would be one of universalism, of a system that puts everyone worldwide on the same playing field — and that doesn’t privilege America over the rest of the globe like the dollar does. This will be an extremely uncomfortable position for the US establishment, because for the first time148in memory they’ll represent the technologically conservative faction, the less universalist side, the pre-modern side. But you can already see the foreshadowing in terms of how legacy media inveighs against technology, how they hate the future, how they want to jam social media and the internet back into the garage, how they want to turn back the clock on all those things that have disrupted their political control. Maximalism is thus a kind of leapfrogging. If Trump invoked a mythical past, and the US establishment represents an attempt to freeze the present in amber, the Bitcoin Maximalists are willing to drive the system towards an uncertain future. That’s why a fair number of conservative Republicans will side with Green, and why revolutionary Democrats will side with Orange. Bitcoin Maximalism is a movement that knows it can’t “Make America Great Again”, because that America no longer exists and perhaps never did, so it’s willing to take the entire fiat system down. Orange is thus comfortable with a higher level of chaos than a suddenly conservative US establishment. It is ok with the uncertainty of crypto-anarchy over the certainty of inflationary tyranny. And it is not looking to mend the federal government, but to end it. Unlike the reformist Republican, Maximalism is playing to win. And so it might. It’s extremely difficult to forecast what happens, but I do think that in the long run the Maximalists may win at leastsometerritory in a Second American Civil War, because they’ll eventually outlast the money printing of the US establishment. The value proposition in the American regions that go Maximalist will be “freedom”, though others will perceive it as anarchy. Why could Maximalists win a war of attrition? Every day the price of BTC/USD goes up is another victory in the Maximalist social war against the US establishment; every day it goes down is a temporary defeat.149Because the US government can’t invade the rest of the world, and because other states won’t necessarily listen to it, it can’t easily seize Bitcoin globally. So long as the long-term price trend is up, which is not guaranteed, then Maximalists win. That does lead to a related point: with an estimated 300M cryptocurrency holders worldwide at the time of writing, hundreds of millions of people who aren’t Maximalists already believe in Bitcoin. And it’s on track to be billions by 2030. So long as those holders don’t sell their Bitcoin, that’s a fundamentally new international support network of a kind that MAGA Republicans don’t have. That is, a man in Brazil doesn’t necessarily care about American Republicans vs Democrats — he’s not an American nationalist, and doesn’t have a dog in that fight — but he may well hold Bitcoin. And so long as he doesn’t sell BTC for dollars, he’s indirectly supporting Maximalists. Yet his foreign support comes in an intangible and ideological form that feels acceptable to the proud American Bitcoin Maximalist, as opposed to (say) the explicit support of a foreign military getting involved on US soil. With that said, the US establishment could also win a war of attrition. Their starting advantages are immense: the universities, the media, the military, the intelligence agencies, most of the tech companies, and the federal government itself. The US establishment also has an elite global support base: all the people who sympathize with it around the world: the McKinsey types, the Ivy grads, the frequent flyer class, and the people who still think America is the country from the movies.150Even if the establishment can’t force foreign governments to seize BTC, they may try seizing Bitcoin for their own reasons, though other states will instead vector towards the direction of economic freedom. Moreover, even if the US establishment does losesometerritory, it will likely hang on to the Northeast and the West Coast. The value proposition in those regions that stick with the establishment will be “democracy”, though others will perceive it as fiat “tyranny”. During all this, the pressure of conflict could force people to the ideological extremes. The closest movie archetypes for the Green and Orange sides could be a more oppressive version of Portlandia and a more functional version of Mad Max. Cartoonish caricatures come to life. If it’s not abundantly clear, I take no sides here, and am not rooting for anarchy. I’d prefer a stable world where we could focus on mathematics and getting to Mars than the chaos that may soon ensue. And I have no illusions about how bad civil conflict can get; there are no unscathed winners in wars. ReadDavid Hinesfor a good depiction of what political violence is actually like. Political violence is like war, like violence in general: people have a fantasy about how it works. This is the fantasy of how violence works: you SMITE YOUR ENEMIES IN A GRAND AND GLORIOUS CLEANSING BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU’RE BETTER. Grand and glorious smiting isn’t actually how violence works. I’ve worked a few places that have had serious political violence. And I’m not sure how to really describe it so people get it. This is a stupid comparison, but here: imagine that one day Godzilla walks through your town. The next day, he does it again. And he keeps doing it. Some days he steps on more people than others. That’s it. That’s all he does: trudging through your town, back and forth. Your town’s not your town now; it’s The Godzilla Trudging Zone. Point: civil conflict is not romantic, it’s not targeted, it’s not proportional. It’s insane. If you think the scenario of American Anarchy is a possibility, you probably want to get as far away from it as you can, regardless of your “sympathies” with either side. And then you should help build a peaceful alternative to American Anarchy. But not the alternative that China will offer, which we’ll cover next. While in the West we may see American Anarchy, in the East we could see Chinese Control. Before the US enters serious internal conflict, it could support some kind of China Coup — whether with words or with more than that — as written about by Roger Garside in the eponymous bookChina Coup, as hinted at by parties as different as George Soros and America’s JSOC, and as previously accomplished in many acknowledged regime changes and unacknowledged Color Revolutions around the world. For reasons we’ll get into, I don’t think such a coup is likely to be successful. But the reaction to any coup attempt by the CCP could be the most intense crackdown on domestic opposition we’ve ever seen. It would be an AI-powered ripping up of Chinese society by the roots that puts every citizen under suspicion and makes it very difficult for Chinese nationals to leave with their property, to “runxue”. It may also be accompanied by deniable (or overt) Chinese retaliation against the US for attempting a coup, retaliation which could take the form of targeted shortages of key physical goods to exacerbate American inflation and supply chain woes. If and when the coup is quashed, the CCP will then export their coup-defeating surveillance state to other countries. And their value proposition to the world will be Chinese Control — the complete opposite of American Anarchy. A specific prediction is that we’ll see a world where it becomes increasingly difficult for Chinese people to leave the country or get their property out of the digital yuan ecosystem without CCP permission. Take the existinghukousystem of internal passports, the WeChat system of red/yellow/greentravel restrictions based on health status, the aggressive COVIDlockdowns, and the recentpassport restrictions— then fuse them with a surveillance state that can track people globally, a WeChat superapp that can unperson them, and a digital yuan that can freeze their assets. There are trends that point in the direction of digital and physical movement restriction already. Chinese passport issuance has alreadydeclined dramatically, down “95 per cent in the first quarter compared to before the pandemic.” Outbound travel issimilarly down95%, with 8.5 million people leaving China in 2021 relative to 154 million in 2019. China has also been using COVID quarantine codes to stop people frommoving moneyor moving around. And Chinesecapital controls, always strict, may get even more intense with the rollout of the digital yuan. So that makes exit hard. Conversely, on the entrance side, while it will still be possible for approved Chinese citizens to travel to places like Iran or Russia that are effectively military allies, the countries where the Chinese state lacks a hard power presence will start turning down Chinese nationals due to espionage concerns. This has already been happening. This combination of outbound restrictions imposed bytheirgovernment and inbound restrictions fromothergovernments will make life hard for the Chinese liberals and internationalists who disagree with the system, the “runxue” types. They won’t be able to politically dissent, but it’ll also be hard for them to leave the country with their property, as many will want to do. Such an act will be prevented or portrayed as a traitorous run-on-the-bank, particularly if the economy isn’t doing well. Think about how enthusiastic Putin has been about the “renationalization of the elites”, and how closely the CCP has been watching Western tactics during the Russo-Ukraine War. They recognize that any commercial linkage with the West is a point of vulnerability during a conflict. So it’s quite likely that CCP will increasingly make it difficult for people to exit physically or digitally. What are the factors that lead us to this prediction, that CCP will emphasize the “loyalty” part ofHirschman’s triadand turn strongly against both voiceandexit? An attempted coup, whether actually American-backed or simply accused of being such, could be the trigger event for rolling out a fearsome system of Chinese Control. AI would be turned on the population, and any even mildly Western-sympathic groups would be pattern-recognized and dug out by their roots. Nationalist mobs might participate, online or even in person. It could get very ugly. The last part is important: Chinese Control would have significant popular support. The country is heavily nationalist now. It is possible the swing towards nationalism partially reverses — there aresignificant factionsin China who do not like the current trend — but I think it’s too much to think that China is going to “go democratic.” America’s internal chaos means it is simply not an admirable model for much of the world anymore, and while some educated Chinese liberals may indeed want torunxue, there is momentum towards nationalism among much of China’s youth. I may be wrong about this, but putting it all on one person or even one party doesn’t feel right. The ideological current towards Chinese ultra-nationalism feels stronger than Xi the person, or even the CCP, and may outlast him in the event of a black swan. Anyway, with the coup defeated, CCP would then sell a turnkey version of their coup-defeating surveillance state to other countries as a way to (a) stop any possible contagion of American anarchy, (b) control crime, (c) prevent increasingly mobile citizens from leaving with their funds to other countries, and (d) prevent unrest of any kind, legitimate or not. It would ensure that any leader currently in charge remains in charge, and would be picked by many governments for exactly that reason. There’s an important caveat to all this. Much Western coverage of China is unremittingly negative. And certainly the scenario described herein is not a particularly rosy one. But we need to temper that negativity with a dose of realism. First, why are we even discussing China? Why aren’t we discussing Chad or Chile? Because China has on balance executed phenomenally well since 1978. After Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, the country really has risen to the workshop of the world, with an enormous trade surplus, a surfeit of hard currency, and dozens of huge new cities. It’s the #2 economy, the #2 military, and the #2 in tech unicorns. All of that happened from a standing start over the last 40-odd years, since Deng’s turnaround of China (calledBoluan Fanzheng). Conversely, over the last 30 or so years, the US establishment has squandered perhaps the greatest lead in human history, going from complete and uncontested dominance in 1991 to internal conflict and potentially implosion. Moreover, as noted inWhat about China, huh?, it’s not that the US establishment is moreethicalthan the CCP when it comes to civil liberties, it’s just less competent. After all, the US establishment also doeswarrantless surveillancevia the NSA, unconstitutionalsearch and seizurevia the TSA, arbitrary confiscationofpropertyviacivil forfeiture, censorship ofpolitical keywordsjust like WeChat, and has pushed fordisinformation agencies,civilian disarmament,digital censorship, and the like. The US establishment copied the CCP on lockdown, without ever really admitting it was doing so, and funded the lab that may have leaked the coronavirus. It’s also bombed and destabilized many countries around the world. And if we’re honest, over the last two decades, the US has killed and displaced far more people abroad than the CCP has. That might be hard to hear for a Westerner, but what all of that means is that (a) the CCP does have some cred with many “neutral” countries, (b) it also has cred with huge swaths of its own population thanks in part to both nationalist propaganda and actual execution, (c) that relative cred will grow if America descends into anarchy, (d) the cred will make it easier for CCP to roll out more Chinese Control at home and abroad, and (e) the cred will actually attract some Chinese ancestry people back to China even as others want to leave. Wait – that last point seems paradoxical. How could people want to come to Chinese Control if we’ve just spent all this time talking about so many want to leave? Think about Microsoft. It’s a strong company. Most people in the world would be glad to get a job at Microsoft. But many of the very best would find it stifling, and would instead strike out on their own to join or found a tech company. There’s simultaneously a demand for some people to join Microsoft while others want to leave. In the case of China, this is compounded by China’s evaporating soft power in regions where it doesn’t have hard power. The climate of suspicion towards Chinese nationals has ramped up dramatically in recent years, and it’s generally not flagged as “racism” by the establishment press. This could make a good number of Chinese ancestry people leave rather than be singled out in the event of a hot conflict. So, that’s what could happen to China: significant inflows of Chinese ancestry people, along with some outflows (or blocked outflows) of elites. And the Chinese Control scenario we’ve described, while dystopian to the ambitious and freedom-seeking, will likely be acceptable to many people who prize stability over all else and see scenes of flames and gunfire (whether representative or not) coming from American Anarchy. It won’t be trivial to beat the average standard of living that Chinese Control may be capable of delivering. It will appeal to many. And that brings us to the International Intermediate. What’s the International Intermediate? They’re just the people who don’t want their societies to descend into American Anarchy, but also want a better option than Chinese Control. That’s India and Israel, but also American centrists, Chinese liberals, global technologists, and people from other places that want to steer a different course from the US establishment, from crypto-anarchy,andfrom Chinese Control. Why mention India and Israel so prominently? Call it a hunch, but those two groups are #1 and #2 in immigrant tech founders in the US. India is, separately, also #3 in tech unicorns after the US and China. At the state level India and Israel are now highly aligned, and at the individual level Indians and Israelis tend to be globally flexible and English-speaking. So, insofar as there is a third technological pole outside the US and China, it will probably have significant Indo-Israeli character, with servers positioned in their respective territories, and deals inked across borders. Of course, it will also have contributions from all around the world. It’s probably easier to say who the International Intermediate isnotthan who it is. It’s not the US establishment, or places heavily aligned with it. And it’s not China or heavily China-aligned regions like Russia and Iran. But it could include places like the Visegrad countries (anti-Russia but also skeptical of much in America), or South Korea (which elected a pro-Bitcoin head of state), or even Vietnam (now pulling away from China to side more with India). Because it’s “everyone else”, by default this International Intermediate is just raw material – the 80% of the world that is not American or Chinese is just a formless mass without internal structure. Indeed, that’s what happened to the “Third World” during last century’s Cold War. The Non-Aligned countries weren’t just not aligned with the US or USSR, they weren’t aligned with each other. This time, however, rather than being the Third World / non-aligned movement, a subset of the many billions of people in the International Intermediate can align around web3 to try to build alternatives to American Anarchy and Chinese Control. And that subset we call theRecentralized Center. Next Section: Victory Conditions and Surprise Endings",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Many video games have the concept of good and bad endings, like Shattered Union and Starcraft. We’ll take that approach with the sci-fi scenario we outlined, describing someVictory Conditionsfor different factions as well asSurprise Endingsthat give an unexpected twist. Again, this is a way to think through an uncertain future with some scenario analysis, not a hard and fast set of predictions. This is a scenario where the US establishment wins, and averts American Anarchy. In 2020, Tyler Cowenwrote abouthow “base-raters” and “growthers” differ regarding the coronavirus. Growthers looked at the growth rate of the virus, which at the time was exponential. Base-raters start by asking how often something has happened before; they assume things will more or less stay the same. So, base-raters assume the post-war order remains intact; the dollar remains number one; the USA stays number one; China will collapse like Japan; everybody always says the West is declining, but it’ll always reinvent itself; it’ll be okay; you’re too concerned or worried about this, etc. If the Base Rate Fallacy is assuming tomorrow will be like today, then the Base Rate FallacyFallacyis assuming that the Base Rate Fallacy is always a fallacy. After all, tomorrow often is like today! The growther always thinks that change is going to happen, but it may not. So what does the establishment win scenario look like? It’s the same thing we’ve already got. The post-war order just keeps on keeping on in a zombified fashion. There’s no dramatic acceleration or collapse. Instead, the West just keeps reinventing itself and all is mostly well. If you want a faithful rendition of this worldview, this thread byVuk Vukovicis decent. I disagree with many bits of it, including the idea thatdiscord is our strength. And I think in general that the thread is fairly anti-empirical; the graph oflong-run interest rate trendsalone shows that something is going to run out of juice eventually. Still, it’s worth a hearing. This is a scenario where the CCP wins, and Chinese Control triumphs. How might China become the most prosperous and stable country in the world, even if it’s unpopular in some places abroad, and even if the US attempts to financially or socially sanction it? China would become an autarkic autonomous autocracy. To understand this, let’s start with a famous libertarian story: “The Pencil.” The idea is that no one person can make a pencil. After all, a seemingly simple pencil is composed of wood, graphite, yellow paint, the metal that contains the eraser, and the eraser rubber itself. But creating each of these things in-house would require running a variety of different agricultural and mining operations. So instead of having one person do all of that, the capitalist system makes a pencil in a “networked” way. We use prices as an API, so that different organizations can spin up, produce components in a cost-effective way, use their profits to grow or maintain themselves, and adapt without coordinating with each other. But that was then. Maybe Chinese Communism with the digital yuan is different. What happens if you have a computer system which reallydoesknow about every vendor, that has every record of every payment, that can actually see the global supply chain, and that knows every single person (or robot) required to make that pencil? It is a large, but finite problem after all. Maybe such a system can solve Hayek’scalculation problem. We already have proof points for this. If you run a two-sided marketplace, you’ll find contra Hayek that notallknowledge is local. For example,Sidecarlost to Uber because drivers set prices themselves, as opposed to setting them centrally. Hayekians would agree that Sidecar’s approach was optimal: drivers have local knowledge and central planning can’t work. But Uber’s central planningdidwork. They had a global view of supply & demand. And riders wanted speed, not price shopping. So, that’s what this win scenario contemplates. If China integrates AI with the digital yuan, and makes their entire economy computable, at their scale they might actually be able to make a pencil. And everything else. Recall that previous abstractions like “six degrees of separation” or “written history” became very real once social networks digitized decades of interaction and communication by billions of people. So too would previous verbal abstractions like “the economy” or “the supply chain” become actual computable objects when you have every transaction and vendor in the same database. Basically, all the blockchain supply chain concept actuallycouldwork, but only if all payments (and hence receipts) are on-chain — or in somethinglikea blockchain, which is what the digital yuan may be. This is doubly true if AI-driven robots are carrying out many of these functions. China might be able to internalize huge swaths of the economy. It could mean full stack production of everything, hyperdeflation of living costs within China, where labor becomes electricity. In this scenario, nooneperson can make a pencil, butChinacan make a pencil, because they can algorithmically coordinate the supply chain of millions of cooperating humans in a way no one has ever been able to do before. They’d still need the raw materials, but their alliances with African countries, Russia, and places like Iran might take care of that. It’s essentially the vision ofRed Plenty, Soviet-style central planning made feasible with superior computationandrobotics — so that the robots actually did what you said they’d do, and didn’t have that pesky self-interest getting in the way like humans did. It’d be a riff on Aaron Bastani’sfully automated luxury communism, where the communistic parts would be the robotic parts — as they would lack any economic interests of their own, and move as one. In this win scenario, the Chinese Communists might have the highest standard of living on the planet, as much higher than the US as the US was relative to the USSR, not only because they actually make physical things, but because they could see the full stack, have data on everything, track every transaction, and deploy AI and robotics in the physical world. Of course, that standard of living would be achieved in an ethnonationalist society with a bone to pick with the US in particular. And it might result in a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere 2.0, this time under Chinese rather than Japanese terms. Everyone would have to bend to Chinese hard power to get the benefit of their robotic economy. In this scenario, the Chinese might even choose to copy the tactics America used in the Russo-Ukrainian war: namely,physicallysanction any group or state that opposes them, thereby cutting them off from the supply of goods from an increasingly physically autarkic China. I don’t like this world, because it cuts against the convenient outcome of the late 20th century, in which the system that produced freedom also produced prosperity. But the experience of two-sided marketplaces shows it is a possibility. In this surprise ending, the U.S. establishment and the CCP work together to stop the global Bitcoin and web3 insurgents. It would be like the US and the USSR aligning against the Third World. Now, there was actually one example where that happened, when the US and the Soviet Union were on the same side, and that was the first Iraq War in 1990. The Soviet Union actuallyvoted with the US in the UN Security Councilto condemn Iraq. That was a huge moment, because normally they were reflexively oppositional. The explicit version would be something like this, where the otherwise hostile US establishment and CCP both decide that BTC and/or web3 are a threat to their power, and try to denounce it at the level of the UN, a bit like their quasi-cooperation on non-political issues. There’s also an implicit version of it, where they team up without teaming up. The US establishment on many levels admires the CCP crackdown on speech. For example, in The Atlantic they saidChina took the right course on internet speech, and in the NYT they noted thatFree Speech Is Killing Us. The US establishment did copy Chinese lockdown, without admitting it. And so you could imagine them teaming up without teaming up, where China does something, then the US establishment copies it, maybe without acknowledging it, and they thereby perform an unacknowledged pincer attack against technologies that oppose them, a bit like the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. We call that scenario the duopoly of digital despotism. A key thesis ofThe Sovereign Individual– and an important argument for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally – is that if a government cannot seize money, then it cannot start wars. Why? If a state can’t coerce, it can’t pay to enforce conscription, or pay the conscripts themselves, or seize the money to pay for all the equipment needed to prosecute the expensive industrialized wars of the 20th and early 21st century. There’s a book calledGold, Blood, and Power: Finance and War Through the Agesthat describes how finance was a weapon of war, and that the 20th century was one of the first times where huge wars have been fought without any country running out of money. The only thing the countries ran out of were bodies, because they were giant centralized states that could seize everything in their territory, and could propagandize everyone in their territory, and could just drive total war. So the Nazis, Soviets, and Americans just grabbed everything in their territory to fight these wars, like enormous ghosts that commanded millions of bodies in these titanic ideological combats. How did they command those bodies? If you think about The Tripolar Triangle, the lower left corner of NYT is voice, and it’s convincing people with words. The lower right corner of BTC is choice or exit, and it’s convincing people with money. You can think of these as left and right democracy respectively. But there’s a third pole. The top pole is loyalty. It’s CCP. Today, it’s AI. And it’s convincing people without convincing people at all. Because they’re all literallyone. It’s harmony. And robots fit at that pole. Why? Because unlike a human soldier, a robot can’t be propagandized. And unlike a human soldier, a robot doesn’t need to be paid, just charged. So: the problem is that Bitcoin could end human war, but not robot War. There would still be the question of funding the industrial capacity to manufacture the robots in the first place. But if you could get past that bootstrap problem…then there’s a scenario where CCP’s AI beats both BTC and NYT, and war keeps going. And now the only reliable soldiers are robot soldiers that can’t be propagandized by NYT and don’t need to be paid in BTC. Next Section: Towards a Recentralized Center",book
https://thenetworkstate.com/towards-a-recentralized-center,"Title: Towards a Recentralized Center
Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. Our base scenario doesn’t contemplate an extended Second Cold War between communism and capitalism. But we do think that the choice between American Anarchy and Chinese Control can be seen as a kind of global ideological struggle of a different kind, as a choice between decentralization and centralization. Do you go with the failed centralization of NYT and the declining US establishment? The total decentralization of Bitcoin Maximalism? Or the totalitarian centralization of the CCP? A better answer might be: none of the above. That instead of choosing either anarchic decentralization or coercive centralization, we choose volitionalrecentralization. When you mention arecentralizedcenter, at first it seems laughable. The centralists will say “what’s the point of decentralizing then? Just stick with our existing system!” And the decentralists will say “new boss, same as the old boss, I prefer freedom!” Derisive references to Rube Goldberg Machines andAnimal Farmwill abound. But the whole point is that the new boss isnotthe same as the old boss, anymore than Apple was the same as BlackBerry, Amazon was the same as Barnes and Noble, or America was the same as Britain. Recentralization means new leaders, fresh blood. Just as companies and technologies keep leapfrogging each other, so too can new societies withOne Commandmentscombine moral and technological innovation to genuinely progress beyond our status quo. Recentralization is not about going full circle and making zero progress. It’s thehelical theoryof history. Recentralization, done right, is a cycle back to centralization from one vantage point but a step forward from another. I don’t agree with him on everything, but Yuval Harari has a good quote on this: I mean we need institutions actually more, but there is this wave of distrust against them. Now, it doesn’t mean we need the old institutions. It doesn’t mean that we have to stick with the old media. Maybe we need new media institutions, which will be more diverse, which will give more people a chance to voice their opinions, but in the end we will need to build these institutions. The idea that we can just do without them, that we’ll have just this free market of ideas and anybody can say anything, and we don’t want institutions to kind of stand in the middle, and curate and decide what is reliable and what is not reliable, this doesn’t work, it’s been tried so many times in history. You know, if you look at religious history, to take a counter example, so you have in Christianity, again and again these people coming and saying, “you know, we don’t want the Catholic Church, this institution, let’s just every person can read the Bible for himself and know the truth, what is more simple than that, why do we need an institution,” and you have the Reformation, the protestant Reformation. And within twenty years or fifty years, they realize that when you let every person read the Bible for themselves you get 100 different interpretations, [each] radically different. So eventually someone comes and says “No, these are the correct interpretations” and you get the Lutheran church. And after 100 years, someone says “wait, but the whole idea of the Reformation was to get rid of the Church so we don’t want the Lutheran church. Let every person just read the Bible and understand by themselves.” And you have chaos. And after 50 years, you have the Baptist church, and this church, and that.. you always go back to institutions. So it’s the same with the kind of information explosion that we have right now. Note that in this example the Protestants, and then the Lutherans, and then the Baptists had toattractpeople to their interpretations. Many other competing denominations did not. This process of constantly forking and innovating and having it compete in the marketplace brings in new blood. And that’s the concept of the recentralized center. The way to demonstrate it’s a step forward is via mass exodus of people from both American Anarchy and Chinese Control to the recentralized center, to high-trust startup societies and network states.

Content: From Nation States to Network StatesChapter 5 Narrated by Balaji AI. Why now? After almost 400 years of the Westphalian nation state, why do we think the status quo could change? First, the status quo. What is the modern nation state, anyway? What is a nation, for that matter? How was state formation enabled long ago by technological innovations likemapmakingandprint capitalism? When did the political events transpire that led to the rise of the nation state? And what were the historical alternatives? Then, the change. What are the contemporary catalysts, the technological and political developments that promise to alter centuries of practice? What are the concepts, charts, calculations, and citations that suggest big changes are in the offing? And what might a network state even look like? Next Section: On Nation States",book

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. You may think you know what a nation state is, but you probably haven’t given it much thought. Poke on the abstraction a bit, and fun ensues. You start realizing how different the nation is from the state, how tricky it is to determine who qualifies as a “nation,” how confusing our modern terminology around this topic is, and how many other modes of human organization represent potential competitors to the nation state. That exploration opens the door to the network state. In the process, you’ll encounter all those philosophers people vaguely recall from school. You know, Locke and Rousseau, Plato and Aristotle, the subjects of countless boring book reports — many of them make a showing in this chapter. But their presence here is different from the typicaldryasdustcollege lecture, because the network state makes political science anappliedscience, more like political technology. You are listening withintent to repeat. That is, just like cryptocurrencies gave people other than the Fed Chair a reason to learn about everything fromseignoragetodemurrage, cryptocountries give people other than the Founding Fathers the ability to put political theory into political practice. But only if you understand that theory, so let’s dive in. The most obvious definition is that a nation state is a geographic region of the world ruled by a group of humans we call a government. It’s what we talk about when we refer to “countries” like the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China. It’s a flag-labeled region on a political map of the globe. Britannicaprovides a more precise definition, namely that a nation state is a “territorially bounded sovereign polity” that is “ruled in the name of a community of citizens that identify themselves as a nation.” And that latter bit is key, because a nation state is notjusta government that controls a territory. It’s supposed to be a government thatrepresentsa distinct people, a nation. There’s an excellent passage from Joshua Keating in his bookInvisible Countrieson the peculiarity of the nation state system. He analogizes the system to a selective club with the following eight rules: Keating goes on to note that the rules of this club are backed by the institutions of the UN and the military force of the US, and that the agreement of billions of people through their governments on the current world order is what preserves “cartographic stasis.” Note that even if one thinks of the UN as ineffectual, it’s a Schelling Point for the system. Nothing else has as much legitimacy, as many backlinks. We can describe the assumptions of the nation state system in a different lens, one that makes it easier to understand the differences between this system and the network state system we will introduce inthe following pages: These cover the six essential parts of the state: borders, population, central government, international sovereignty, diplomatic recognition, and the domestic monopoly on violence. Understanding the term “nation state” requires us to distinguish the nation (a group of people with common descent, history, culture, or language) from the state (their government). They are not the same. Even though “nation” is oftenconflatedwith “state,” the term “nation state” has two words for a reason. The first word (nation) has the sameetymologicalroot as “natality.” It once denoted a group of people with shared ancestry. The second word (state) refers to the entity that governs these people, that commands the police and the military, and that holds the monopoly of violence over the geographic area that the nation inhabits. In a sense, the nation and the state are as different as labor and management in a factory. The former are the masses and the latter are the elite. The textbook nation state is something like Japan, in which a single group with shared ancestry and culture (the Japanese) occupies a clearly delineated territory (the islands of Japan) and is ruled by a clear sovereign (the Japanese government) which is representative of the people in some sense (originally via thedivine, contemporaneously via theDiet). This gives us a new perspective on whymicronationslike Sealand don’t work: they start backwards, from the territory and the government, rather than working forwards from a people and their culture. The latter process is how nation states historically emerged: a state was set up by a nation to govern it, not vice versa…though then that self-same state often began theprocessofassimilatingothers into its founding nation, so it was a bidirectional process. Bidirectionality notwithstanding, the egg of the nation precedes the chicken of the state. From this perspective, a better term than micronation is really microstate, because it’s not a micro-nationunless it represents a smallgroupof aligned people. A single person self-proclaiming a government is just a tiny state. As the saying goes, you and what army? Without a nation, there is no army - and no legitimacy.151 On the other side of the spectrum is an empire, or multination. The Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Soviet Empire contained many nations and ethnic groups. This vantage point allows us to rectify more vocabulary. The concept of a multinational corporation, for example, is something of a misnomer; the right term is a multi-statecorporation (which operates across polities), as opposed to a multi-nationalstate (which manages the affairs of many different ethnic groups within its boundaries). In between 0-nation microstates and N-nation empires are 1-nation states, governments that are set up to manage the affairs of a single ethnic group in a defined territory. However, while this kind of terminology is not exactlydeprecated, it’s a bit old-fashioned. It’s not how we tend to talk about nation states in the current year. First, today we often discussmultiethnicstates — multinations, like the USA — which are reallymoreliketheempiresof yore than a classical monoethnic nation state. Second, many contend that physical borders don’t matter in the age of the internet. Third, modern discourse focuses to a much greater extent onproposition nations, where shared ideas are the organizing principle rather than shared inheritance. Fourth, and most importantly, conflict between ethnic groups within states can result incivil war,mass deportation,totalitarian brainwashing,ethnic cleansing,forced conversion, andcultural destruction, the kind of process that recently resulted in the formations ofEast TimorandSouth Sudan. Later, we’ll talk about how network states address these issues, but these are the (understandable!) reasons why the distinction between thenationand thestatehas fallen out of favor. Scholars don’t want to inadvertently encourageseparatismorirredentismorworse, lest people think it’s not arealnation state unless the political entity (the state) represents all the members of a single ethnicity (the nation) in all the lands around the world where they preponderate. Or at least, they don’t want to do so domestically. Because the average American is a bit schizophrenic when it comes to terminology like this. He can easily understand the desire of, say, the Ukrainian people to break free of the Russian empire, or for the Tibetan nation to have their own government separate from the Chinese state, or for the Persian people to distinguish themselves from the theocracy of Iran. But the same person is typically more skeptical that Britain should have exited the European Union, let alone that the “Texan nation” should have its own sovereign state. The cynical might say that national aspirations get airtime in proportion to the national interest; the more cynical might say that even the term “national interest” is yet another misnomer, because it’s more like the “state’s interest” given that the American state rules more thanone nation. This, however, leads us to the key question of what exactly constitutes a nation. This question was once all-important: what groups are significant enough to be called nations, candidates for a state of their own? It will soon be all-important again, as important as “what is a currency,” and for similar reasons: because Bitcoin, web3, the metaverse, remote work, mobile, and the internet allow people toexitlegacy arrangements and form new groups more easily than at any time in the recent past. But which of these groups should be considered a “nation”? Let’s start withOxford’s definition by way of their free serviceLexico: A large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory. From that definition, we can extract the following properties: Each of these pieces can be poked at. How large is “large”? How do we measure whether a group of people is united? How localized to a particular territory does a nation have to be, or can it benomadic? And why do we have a complex“OR” statementburied in the middle, where common descent, history, culture,orlanguage all figure in? Our first instinct is that the definition of a nation is a little fuzzy, and our instinct is right. To ground our discussion, let’s go through specific examples of groups that have been called nations: The Japanese: They line up with the definition perfectly. The Japanese at one point did have quite anempire, and there is a Japanese diaspora in the US (and Brazil)…but most people of Japanese ancestry live on the islands of Japan, speak the Japanese language, are governed by the Japanese state, and live in an essentially monoethnic polity. The Spanish: They have a nation state today, but in the past they had an international empire that then contracted, leaving them mostly to themselves on the Iberian Peninsula. They left behind a global footprint in the form of 20 countries thatspeak Spanish, yet do not consider themselves part of the Spanish nation state. The Turks: They are a multiethnic state today that is also the successor to an even larger empire, the Ottoman Empire, with adefinitionally Byzantinehistory. The Israelis: Their status as a nation state changed with time. The Jewish people were once a stateless nation, a diasporic group united by common ancestry and tradition without a land or government to call their own. Then, within living memory, they founded the state of Israel. (Herzl’s workis a major inspiration for this book.) The Catalonians, the Kurds, and the Palestinians: Of course, for every Spain, Israel, or Turkey, there is a Catalonia, a Palestine, a Kurdistan — namely a group that self-identifies as a nation and feels its national aspirations have been denied. These arestateless nations, as distinct from nation states, without necessarily endorsing any particular cause. The Irish: They now have anindependent Ireland, but famously didn’t for many years under the British. A controversial issue is whetherNorthern Irelandshould be part of the Republic of Ireland, or part of the UK. The Taiwanese: This group isrecognizedas a nation by some parties but by no means all. We can think of these aspartially sovereign nations, with a measure of control over their own state and territory, but less than they’d like. The Americans, the Singaporeans, and the French: These states have tried, with varying success, to craft a common identity as a “nation” from the raw material of several different ethnic groups. Indeed, the Americans have, by some measures, been very successful in this effort — at least for a time. TheAmericans, theSingaporeans, and theFrenchare explicitlyproposition nations. The Chinese and the Indians: These gigastates are not really single-nation states given the sheer multiplicity of different groups within each country’s borders. However, those different groups didn’t all recently arrive next to each other like a Burning Man encampment. They’ve been living alongside each other for centuries in a common civilization, with greater and lesser levels ofpastunification, so the grouping is more “Lindy” than more recent multiethnic states with less of a long-term track record, let alone the wholly arbitrary states left in the wake of colonialism. Some have used the termcivilization statefor these entities. You might even stretch this to encompass the European Union, though it is more of a transnational bureaucracy than an entity that celebrates European civilization. And for many Middle Eastern and African countries, thestates don’t really reflect the underlying nations at all. A clue here is the presence of horizontal or vertical lines on a map, lines that don’t reflect the organic physical (deserts, mountains, rivers) and cultural (languages, marriages, religions) barriers that help define nations. Many of these “imposed states” are a parting gift fromcolonial empires. From these examples, we can already see quite a bit of variation: Just by touring this topic, we also see that the issue of “what is a nation” is still the hot button, the third rail, the pulse raiser, the argument starter. Because a nation granted legitimacy can claim territory and erect a polity, while a nation denied recognition remains landless and stateless, the stakes couldn’t be higher for this seemingly abstract question. We just did some specific examples. Can we enunciate general principles that define which groups should be consideredbona fidenations? Many scholars from the past to the recent present have taken a crack at this question. Here’s a necessarily incomplete précis of their views, taken in part from Benner’s chapterhereand Kaufmann’s reviewhere. First, the thinkers of the late 1700s and 1800s, writing during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, or the Revolutions of 1848: These definitions both overlap and conflict. Some tensions include: These divergences mean there isn’t yet a single test for whether a group is a nation, though one can make a more or less persuasive case in any given instance by appealing to different standards. However, with modern tools, we might be able to tidy up that fuzziness. Later in this chapter, we’ll introduce a computational approach to defining a nation that complements the empirical and philosophical approaches. And we’ll talk about how these theories of national origin influence a startup society founder’s strategy for “customer acquisition,” or in this casecitizen acquisition. But for now, what is a nation? Perhaps it’s just a group that can convince enough other people that it’s a nation. It’s also worth spending time on the other half of the nation state definition: what exactly is astate? This helpfulvideoenumerates six properties of a state: A failed state in the midst of civil war wouldn’t fit, for example, because it wouldn’t be able to prevent foreign powers from interfering (item 4), nor would it be able to control violence domestically (item 6). A micronation doesn’t count because it lacks territory (item 1) and population (item 2). And an administrative subdivision of the US like Arkansas also wouldn’t count, because it lacks recognition by foreign states (item 5) and control relative to Washington, D.C. (item 3). However, a subdivision can sometimesbecomean independent state. How about a comparison? Precisely because they’re so oftenconflated, it’s worth addressing in detailjust howa state differs from a nation. Nations may not always have a single state. The Kurds lack a state, while the Koreans are split into two states. Conversely, states may govern one or more nations. The British state governs the English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish nations, while the Soviet state governed more than100 different nationalities. While some contend that the distinction between nation and state is an intrinsically European idea, there are actually different words for these concepts across languages. Perhaps the simplest test for whether something is abona fidestate is whether it’s a member of the United Nations General Assembly. Does it have sufficient diplomatic recognition? Is it considered a state by other entities we’d consider states? In a word, is itrecognized? This is important because even the very largest groups of people, like the Chinese and the Indians, are outnumbered by the rest of the world; social viability is necessary for state viability. A couple of excellent books on this topic areInvisible CountriesandNot on the Map, which review edge cases like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Transnistria, Northern Cyprus, Somaliland, South Ossetia, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Kosovo, and Taiwan. Each of these entities has a greater or lesser degree of internal state-like-ness, with Taiwan being the most legit, but all of them lack some degree of full interstate recognition — often due to a powerful regional or global opponent. While we’re discussing the UN, a better name than the “United Nations” might be the “Selected States.” After all, many stateless nations don’t have a seat in the United Nations General Assembly, like the Kurds, the Catalonians, or the Tibetans. And many countries thatdohave seats are more akin to multinational empires than single-nation states. Keynes said “Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” Meaning, if you don’t know what intellectual software you’re running, you’re probably running it unconsciously. So, it’s hard to survey the many thinkers that led to the modern state, because we don’t always understand the full scope of their impact. We’ll try anyway. Here’s another necessarily imprecise set of summaries of what different political theorists thought about the state. Again, this isn’t just desiccated theory. It’s important to understand these ideas because they are usedimplicitlyorexplicitlyby the founders and leaders of actually existing states. From a computer science standpoint, these schools of thought arestatecraft strategiesthat are analogous toprogramming paradigms. That is, you can oftensolvethe same problem from (say) an object-oriented, functional, or imperative standpoint. But certain problems are easier to tackle with a particular paradigm, while others become muchharder. So too for these varying theories of the state. Moreover, rather than being used in isolation, these statecraft strategies are often fused within a single legal codebase, much as different programming paradigms can complement each other within a company’s codebase. For example, Karl Marx’s zero-sum worldview made it easy to justify a Soviet state with a massive Red Army to destroy the capitalist oppressors. Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s writing by contrast didn’t give much justification for the use of force itself, but furnished a vision of consensualcommunistic utopiathat sat just on the other side of the Red Army’s liberating violence.Carl SchmittandThomas Carlyleare a roughly equivalent pairing on the right, with Schmitt advocating that a hero use state force against the enemy and Carlyle talking up the bounteous order that would arise as a result. Marx and Rousseau’s failure mode was their departure from economic reality, as they didn’t take into account self-interest. Schmitt and Carlyle’s failure mode was their departure from political reality, as they didn’t take into account the interests of the other guy. But their statecraft strategies were once influential enough to drive some of the most powerful states in world history, so we need to understand them, even if we must also discard them. Think about how PHP is a programming language that “sucks” according to many engineers, yetsomehow led to many ofthe most popular apps of all time (Facebook, WordPress, Slack, etc), and you’ll get the point. It is also possible to run completely in another direction, and have a purely contractual state run on an implicitly Hayekian/Lockean paradigm, maximizing some measure of wealth without any of themeaningthat the Marxist or Schmittian state narratives provide. That also has its vulnerabilities, as a vacuum of meaning can be filled by a rival whose statecraft strategy involvesconstantevangelism; this is why the Platonic/Aristotlean state narratives have a good point when they prioritizepurpose. The strengths and weaknesses of various statecraft strategies can be discussed at length, and we’ll return to this topic. But for now: before you design your ideal state, you should have some idea of what others thought their ideal state to be, and how that worked out. The simple answer is that a nation state is a colored blob on a map. But we can think of that map as asuperpositionof various underlying maps showing where members of the nation are located — for example, where the speakers of the language, those with shared alleles, and those with similar culture reside, overlaid on the legal boundaries of the state). Again, Japan is our canonical example. The underlying maps all line up. Most speakers of the Japanese language, most people with Japanese ancestry, most holders of the Japanese yen, most practitioners of Shintoism, and most people who are culturally Japanese live in the islands of Japan administered by the Japanese government. Other nations are much messier than that. Some nations have spread fractally around a territory, as in the Balkans. Some nations have spread around the world, as did the Jewish community pre-Israel (still true to a significant extent today). Some previously unified nations have been split between territories for historical reasons, as are North and South Korea. Other nations are defined by multiple overlapping maps, because one variable alone is not enough to delimit them. For example, if you just said that all people who speak Spanish are members of the Spanishnation, you would misclassify millions of people across continents who do not think of themselves as part of the same community. Some “nation states,” like Indonesia, have odd-looking boundaries — in part, because they are really multinational states. Some “nation states,” like France and the United Kingdom, have surprisingly distributed global footprints because they are really the remains of multinational empires. In general, the idealized nation state is one where the members of a given group — the nation — are physicallycentralizedwithin a single bounded set on the surface of the globe. That may seem trivial, but later in this chapter we’ll explore physicallydecentralizedpolities in the context of network states. There are a few different angles on the question of how nation states get founded. The first angle is to think about when many states were founded on roughly the same principles at the same time. We can define a few critical moments in history. WW2 and Cold War (1945-1991): today’s states were founded under the aegis of the postwar order. After World War II, within Europe large-scale population transfers created monoethnic states. Meanwhile, outside Europe, the colonies owned by Western European powers experienced “decolonization” and then arguably “recolonization” by the USSR or USA respectively in the name of communism or capitalism. Another clutch of independent states arose after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. American Revolution, French Revolution, Great Divergence (1776-1800s): Writers like Benedict Anderson date the rise of European nationalism in its modern sense to the “Great Divergence” of the early 1800s, after the French Revolution, which was in turn inspired by the American Revolution. 30 Years War, Spanish/Dutch War, and Peace of Westphalia (1618-1648): The Peace of Westphalia ended the 30 Years War between Protestants and Catholics that had been kicked off by the Reformation, and ushered in the concept of states with bounded territorial sovereignty as opposed to the unbounded authority of the Catholic Church. Rise ofmapmakingandprint capitalism(1500s): The rise of mapmaking technologies enabled the creation of accurate maps. We take this for granted today, but without good maps there were no explicit borders beyond terrain, only gradual diminishment of the power of one sovereign as its territory bled into that of another. Ancient era.Civilization states like China and India date their origins back to antiquity, and can point to certain continuities of language, culture, and religious practice. Prehistory.Primordialistsargue that the nations that underpin states predate written history, as their linguistic, genetic, and cultural bonds stretch back thousands of years. In other words, nations are naturally occurring phenomena, more like the periodic table of the elements than a social construct, with boundaries that are obvious in a Potterian sense. Any real modern nation state was in this sense founded millennia ago. Importantly, the whole world didn’t get modern nation states at the same time. For example, Westphalian sovereignty was initially establishedwithinWestern Europe, but not outside it. European nation states were supposed to honor each others’ borders, in principle at least, so theywent abroadto conquer other places. But these junction points in history are still useful ways to think about the founding of nation states, with one or the other looming larger depending on whether one is more focused on the “nation,” the “state,” or the “nation state” combination. From a practical standpoint, clearly you can’t found a civilization state like China or India without thousands of years of history. But you might be able to distill a new “nation” like theMormons(est: 1830) from the mass of Americans, or alternatively architect an impressive new nation state like“E”-stonia(est: 1991) from the same nation oppressed by the drearyEstonian Soviet Socialist Republic. An alternative approach is to look at the details of how specific nation states were founded. One thing that pops out to us when studying enough of these histories is that national independence is not solely a matter of self-determination, because the fate of many nations is not determined wholly by their own efforts. For example, the Soviets were “anti-imperialist” when that meant getting Western-sympathetic capitalists out, and Soviet-sympathetic communists in. The French supported the fledgling American nation when that meant poking a thumb in the eye of their British rivals. And today’s Americans haven’t been too vocal on the Kurds or Yemenis given their alliances with the Turkish and Saudi states, but are extremely enthusiastic about the Ukrainians, Taiwanese, and Uighurs given their conflicts with the Russian and Chinese states. As such, to achieve its ambitions a stateless nation may also need a patron, a kind of venture capitalist Great Power. Self-determination is not enough. Many countries were founded within living memory, but because they were often founded by force, some don’t believe it’s possible to found new countrieswithoutforce. Or is it? They sayyou cannot found a Pentagon; theydon’tsay you can’t found a competitor to thepost office, or thetaxi medallion system, or toNASA. They instead go right to the thing where we don’t have comparably recent foundings…ordowe? After all, the Pentagon itself was built by human beings just like you and me in1943. India, Israel, and Singapore were likewise founded in 1947, 1948, and 1965 respectively, and have their own defense department equivalents. Of course, there are other interpretations of this challenge. It could mean “OK, it happened a while ago, but I don’t think the Pentagon-forming process can be repeated,” or perhaps “It would be bad to raise a massive new army, as that would be destabilizing,” or even, “Come on, you can’t found the most powerful military in the world from scratch.” But answering these kinds of questions presents an embedded Catch-22. Either someone thinking about starting new countries must want to create a powerful new military (dangerous!) or else they don’t have any guns and will get crushed by those that do (dangerously naive). One answer is that you don’t need to get full sovereignty but can instead contract with an existing sovereign for defense. In fact, this is that this is actually what most “real” countries already do — few truly have full sovereignty, as most contract out their defense in a similar manner way to the US or (nowadays) China. Another answer is that you could write a book just on this (and perhaps we’ll need to add another chapter), but for a fundamentally digital entity with physical decentralization around the world, the primary mode will be nonviolent digital defense through secrecy, pseudonymity, decentralization, and encryption. In different ways, Google and Bitcoin protect many millions of people’s digital footprint without an enormous army. Another way of asking this is: what came before the nation state? The short answer is that people had differentidentity stacks. In Europe, the populace didn’t think of themselves as all being primarily “French” or “German” till much later on. They instead thought of themselves on the basis of their feudal lord or region (Brittany, Prussia) or religion (e.g., Protestant/Catholic). Transnational entities like the Catholic Church also claimed dominion over all believers, no matter where they might be, so there was a question as to whether Pope or King had ultimate authority in any given jurisdiction.Wars ensued. ThePeace of Westphalia in 1648resolved these issues and is considered by many to be the origin of the European nation state. The Westphalian peace divided territory by lines on a map. Over each territory thus delineated, there was a government that represented the people in that territory, with the right to exercise force on their behalf. And these “sovereign” states were supposed to leave each other alone. In theory, the state was meant to be an innovation in violence reduction. You stay in your lane, I stay in mine. Clear sovereigns would keep domestic order, and the principle of national sovereignty would deter aggression from abroad. It didn’t entirely work out like that, of course; bothintrastateandinterstateconflict still occurred. But the abstraction of nation states may still have been preferable to the preceding era of fuzzy bordered empires and conflicting sovereigns. There are at least four ways a nation state expands: Demographically.By reproduction or immigration. A nation grows when it sees more birth than death. A state grows when one of its constituent nations experiences demographic growth, or when it adds immigrants, which may be from adifferent nation. Note that there can be a difference here between expansion of the state and the nation! Geographically.By conquest (e.g., Ivan the Terrible’sexpansion of Russia), by acquisition (e.g., theLouisiana Purchase), or by agreement (e.g., Singapore’s involuntaryseparationfrom Malaysia). Economically.By trade and opening of markets. This is not always peaceful: see theBritish East India Company,Smedley Butler, and theOpium Wars. Ideologically.By education and conversion. Revolutionary France invested heavily in educating all citizens to speakFrench, expanding the self-identified French nation. Similarly, Christian, Muslim, and Communist groups spent immense effort on evangelism. Of course, while some of this evangelism grows the support base of a nation state (likeMaoismdid for the PRC and arguablyWahhabismdid for Saudi Arabia), other kinds of viral ideas cut across the boundaries of state and nation alike in destabilizing ways. Nation state formation is bidirectional; nations create states which influence nations, and so on. While a nation must come first, many of history’s most successful nation states drew adjacent (and then non-adjacent) people into the founding population by means ranging fromcultural appealtorape and pillage. Prior toGaribaldi, only about2.5% of “Italians”spokewhat we now know as Italian, but what was then the Florentine dialect of Italian. Similarly, before the French Revolution, less than50% of Francespoketoday’s official variety of French. And until Bismarck’sunificationof Germany, there wasrivalrybetween Prussia and Austria (“German dualism”) for exactly how and whether a “Germany” should be formed. A related phenomenon is the feedback loop between political borders and national culture. The38th paralleldidn’t have pre-existing historical significance in Korean culture, but after the Korean War the rate of intermarriage between the new “North Korean” and “South Korean” groups plummeted. This state of affairs has persisted for 70 years; the longer it continues, the larger the cultural gap between the two groups. Hard political boundaries of this kind serve much the same purpose as natural physical boundaries in the past like rivers, mountains, and deserts. They impede allelic and cultural diffusion, and thus contribute to nation-forming dynamics. There’s a feedback loop between the political/territorial and the linguistic/genetic/cultural. What isnota nation state? I don’t mean this in the trivial way that a banana is not a nation state. I mean, what is another large-scale way of organizing people in the physical world that is not a nation state? Put another way, to understand what something is, we need to understand what it is not. We live in a world of nation states, so conceptualizing something different is difficult. The ideal counterexamples are things that are close, but not quite there. Here are a few: Multiethnic empireslike the Soviet Union were not traditional nation states because they had more than one nationality within their boundaries. Stateless nationslike the Kurds are not nation states because they lack a formally recognized territory and government. Transnational movementslike the Catholic Church are not nation states because the set of all believers is not contained within a territorial state that it administers. (The Church does haveVatican City, but that is about as ceremonial as the British Royal Family.) Terrorist groupslike ISIS which operate across borders and have seized territory at times aren’t considered states because they lack diplomatic recognition (due to their heinous crimes!). That said, the Soviet Communistswere the ISISof their day, and they just had to hold out 16 years for FDR torecognize them, so with enoughpersistencethis designationcan change. Nomadic tribeslike theRomaniandMasaiare not nation states, because they migrate between countries. Indeed, most of humanity used to live like this, with farming/soldiering being a relatively recent innovation, and we may return to something like it with the advent of digital nomadism. Multijurisdictional corporationslike Google have more people on their servers than most countries, and do control huge chunks of their users’ lives, such as their messages and balances. However, they are a transitional form towards our concept of the network state, as their users lack the national consciousness of a nation and their governance lacks the qualities we’ve come to expect from a state. Ethnic diasporaslike the Japanese or Armenian diasporas are not nation states. They may have business districts, and some degree of community organization in those regions, but they are just a tendril of a nation rather than a full nation, and certainly lack the properties of a full state. Local clanslike thePashtun and Hazaraof Afghanistan are not nation states. They are different nations within a failed state. Supranational entitieslike the European Union, WTO, or IMF are also not nation states, and are more similar to the Catholic Church in terms of their cross-jurisdictional influence.152 We don’t typically think of mapmaking, printing, and shooting as novel activities, because the underlying technologies were invented so many generations ago. But they were each foundational to our modern concept of states with borders, where men with guns enforce written laws. Mapmaking.It’s only possible to have a map of the world which we divide into nation states if we have a map of the world. You don’t have to be a cartographic connoisseur to know that such a map did not exist in 1492, when Columbus sailed the ocean blue in search of an India to trade with. “Ye olde” maps with “here be dragons” had to be painstakingly crafted. Prior to modern GPS, there was an enormous tech stack around mapmaking, including compasses, telescopes, and celestial navigation. Printing.Not just the printing press, but the entire practice ofprint capitalismhelped give rise to the nation state. Just as Facebook and Google wanted everyone on the internet so they could expand their customer base, the new commercial printers of the 1500s wanted everyone to speak the same language so they could maximize sales for their goods. Shooting.“God made men, but Sam Colt made them equal.” Feudalism was enforced by horseback-riding knights in shining armor with heavy swords; guns changed that. Others have written about the transition to the gun age, but in short, guns reduced the importance of physical inequality. Any man (or, eventually, woman) with a gun could kill any other man, even if the shooter was old and frail and the shootee was Sir Lancelot himself. The advent of firearms (and crossbows, and cannons) destabilized the feudal hierarchy; a strong right arm was suddenly worth less than a strong left brain, as the technology and supply chain required to produce muskets was suddenly worth more. The gun helped catalyze the transition from feudal hierarchy to nationalist republic and helped promote the “republican” ideals of the American and French Revolutions. So: a combination of mapmaking, printing, and shooting helped set the stage for the post-Westphalian nation state, where a map delimited borders, a printed document established the law, and a guy with a gun shot you for crossing those borders or breaking the law.

Content: Narrated by Balaji AI. The publisher of this work is 1729. It’s named after theRamanujan number, which symbolizes for us thedark talent: all those people from the middle of nowhere, passed over by the establishment, with crazy-but-correct ideas, who could do great things if only given the opportunity. These are exactly the kinds of people who we expect will found startup societies and network states. It’s also a community for people interested in mathematics, cryptocurrencies, seasteading, transhumanism, space travel, life extension, and initially-crazy-seeming-but-technologically-feasible ideas…like network states themselves.
