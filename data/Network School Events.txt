2. Himalayan Kriya Yoga
Date & Time: Wednesday, March 12 | 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM
Location: Floor 3 near the Gym
Hosted By: Yana Kultysheva
Attendees: 1 Going
About Event:
 Himalayan Kriya Yoga is a form of energy yoga. Its practice is similar to Kundalini Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong, but it’s more raw, primal, and dynamic. Instead of the usual yoga poses on a mat, we’ll be moving, shaking, breathing, and tapping to get your energy flowing.
In Kriya, each part of the body stores certain unprocessed emotions and blockages, and we’ll be releasing them one by one.
The movements are simple and intuitive—no experience needed. It’s a great way to relax, boost your energy, and shake off any post-workout tension.
