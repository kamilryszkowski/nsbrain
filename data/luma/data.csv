Description: ​Join us for an engaging meetup where we'll delve into OpenAI's latest announcement of tools designed to build AI agents. Following our previous sessions on AI Agents – State of the Union, this event will adopt a practical approach. Bayram will demonstrate how he has utilized these new tools to develop specific AI agents aimed at automating sales processes.​In their recent announcement, OpenAI introduced several key tools:​-Responses API: A new API primitive that combines the simplicity of Chat Completions with the tool-use capabilities of the Assistants API, enabling developers to build agents that can perform complex tasks using multiple tools and model turns.​- Built-in Tools:​-Web Search:Allows agents to retrieve real-time information from the web, enhancing their ability to provide up-to-date responses.​-File Search: Enables agents to access and search through large volumes of documents, useful for tasks like customer support or legal assistance.​-Computer Use: Empowers agents to perform tasks on a user's behalf, such as navigating websites or executing commands, using OpenAI's Operator model.​-Agents SDK: A toolkit that helps developers orchestrate single-agent and multi-agent workflows, simplifying the management and coordination of complex tasks.​These tools streamline core agent logic, orchestration, and interactions, making it significantly easier for developers to build useful and reliable agents. Over the coming weeks and months, OpenAI plans to release additional tools and capabilities to further simplify and accelerate the development of agentic applications on their platform.

Description: ​Hey everyone! Sam here!👋 Welcome to our part 3 of our 4-part series on China—a country with a past as rich as its ambitions for the future. From ancient philosophies and revolutionary politics to cutting-edge tech and global trade, China’s story is as complex as it is influential.​​There’s a lot of noise and half-truths out there about China. My goal with this series is to cut through the confusion and dive into what really drives this nation. We’ll be exploring four key themes—history, culture, politics, and economics—to get a clear view of what’s happening behind the headlines.​​Here’s a sneak peek at what we’ll cover:​​📜History: How We Got Here​​Opium War to End of Civil War:From gunboats and opium to revolutions and warlords—how a ""Century of Humiliation"" set the stage for modern China.​​Civil War to Reform and Opening:Mao vs. Chiang, the birth of the PRC, and how Deng Xiaoping pressed ‘reset’ on everything.​​Reform and Opening to Made in China 2025:From ""to get rich is glorious"" to leading the world in AI and EVs—China’s economic speedrun explained.​​📚Culture: The Roots and Realities​​The BIG Philosophies:Confucianism, Communism, and Pragmatism—how these ideologies weave together to shape Chinese political and social thought.​​Chinese Business Culture:Guanxi, Face, and the High-Context, Low-Trust Society—decoding the unwritten rules that can make or break deals in China.​​Modern Youth Culture:From internet slang and Bilibili to cultural erosion and the battle for identity—how China’s younger generations are reshaping and challenging tradition.​​🏛Politics: Who Runs the Show and How​​Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour, Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore:How a train ride and a city-state influenced China’s economic miracle. 🚄​​State, Party, and Utopia:How China’s unique governance system works and what makes it tick—no cold war clichés, promise.​​Parallel Universes?:Breaking down the Chinese state organs and their U.S. counterparts—who’s the Congress and who’s the Supreme Court in China’s world?​​Beijing’s Long-Term Vision:From common prosperity to technological self-reliance—how China’s leadership is planning decades ahead to reshape the nation’s future. 🌏​​📊Economics: The Engine Behind the Dragon​​Central Planning and State Capitalism:How China blends market mechanisms with state control to drive growth and maintain stability—deciphering the role of SOEs, Five-Year Plans, and the “visible hand” of Beijing.​​Debt, Real Estate, and Shadow Banking:Breaking down China’s economic Achilles' heel—how debt-fueled growth and the property sector’s risks impact both domestic stability and global markets.​​Belt and Road and Beyond:Understanding China’s global economic strategy—how infrastructure investments, trade agreements (like RCEP), and institutions (like AIIB) aim to reshape the world order.​​So, if you’re ready to move past the headlines and really understand what makes China tick—without getting lost in translation—stick around.
