23,Marine,mpo6165,"Hello 👋 I'm Marine, founder of MC² Finance, a DeFi infrastructure protocol that's bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi yields.

My Background:
— Led investments across multiple crypto projects both professionally (through VC funds) and personally
— Served as a board member advising organizations including the BBC on their web3 strategy
— Deep expertise in both traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems, official LinkedIn instructor for Blockchain in the French Market. 

**About MC² Finance:**
We're building a platform that crowdsources the best DeFi strategies through our proprietary analytics engine and lists them as ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) on traditional stock exchanges. This creates an accessible on-ramp for TradFi to participate in DeFi yields.

We're backed by notable investors including Animoca and Tenity (the Swiss vc fund of UBS, and Franklin Templeton and other large Banks) and while our analytics and trading engines are live in beta, we have partnerships lined up to launch our first ETP in the next 6 month on the Swiss Stock Exchange.

37,Nikolaus (Nik),nikolaus.heger,"Hi everyone, I am Nikolaus (Nik), born in Austria (Europe, no kangaroos). Programming the new earth / heaven on earth economy. 

I moved to silicon valley when it was cool, at Apple ATG initially, later some startups, then left before it became uncool, was a digital nomad in Thailand, living the dream, mountain villa, wife,  2 kids, car - then ended up taking 3 years off on a spiritual path, sat with teachers and Gurus, became determined to reach enlightenment, meditated, found the most direct teachings, ended up in Bali without the ex-wife but with the kids which was / is epic, they are the best 😉 
One day, I became aware of reality - and that was enough for me and I got the message, back to work now! The next day, I was hired as CTO of an ICO play - it fell apart quickly, but I learned a lot. Then I worked on Seeds and Hypha DAO, a conscious currency and a DAO platform. 

I am very much interested in the idea of network state; it is very clear to me that society is collapsing, not fit for a new state of consciousness emerging on earth, and the vision was always to build the new earth instead of fighting the old. Been on this journey for 6 years now - it's going to happen. 

Burning man was my inspiration for what an utopian society can look like - everyone volunteers, everyone does what they like to do, and everything gets done synchronistically. A giving economy. 

But before we get there on a large scale and in the real world, blockchain is our bridge - to get out of the money slave system and create peace on earth. Any currency that's not corrupted basically would do - but blockchain is a technology that just so happens to fit the bill.

39,Jim,jim_nomad,"Hi I’m Jim, coming back to NS on May 1. Good to e-meet so many inspiring NS members. Big thanks to Balaji and NS admin team for Network School. I am grateful for the continuous opportunity to learn from everyone at Network School and to network. My intro (for NS pals)

👷 Professionally: Consulting, infrastructure/transportation, agribusiness, and more recently in education.

🌏 Network state/society community discussion participation: 1729, Plumia discussion groups, Network Society Camp, TNS Connect Writers, Network School v1, etc.

👨‍🍼 Personally: Raising two young sons who I hope become Netizens.

📖 Areas of interest, research, and hoping to learn:
* How the network could enable us to transcend nation state boundaries and identity stack. (The nation state through passports/national ID/SS # define our identity stack from birth to death…could that change?)

* How network societies could become multi-generational and develop more innovative educational paths. (I hope my sons and others in their generation continue the momentum to grow up and be educated as Netizens.)

* How network strength could help diaspora communities survive amid geopolitical tensions and fearmongering. (As Chinese-American I worry about Sinophobia & McCarthyism/yellow peril narratives like what happened in Indonesia in 1990’s; anti-Chinese diaspora sentiment on the rise in Philippines where I am based.)

Chinese-American, studied cognitive science at UC Berkeley. Explored tech in Silicon Valley (VR/AR, 3D printing, crypto, maker culture). Currently traveling Southeast Asia after two years in Mexico City.

My work spans education (built makerspaces for 10,000+ high schoolers in Peru/Colombia), health (co-founded IBDCoach), crypto (community strategy @ web3 venture studio and protocols), and now AI. 

For the last three years, I've focused entirely on AI—building and deploying ideas quickly.

Currently building Speak To Earn to empower native speakers from low-resource communities, helping create AI that reflects humanity's linguistic diversity. Recently won two first place prizes at the Safe Agentathon (https://devfolio.co/projects/yapper-9cfd).

I think deeply about starting conditions for products, communities, and societal transformation. At scale, startup societies are an alignment problem—bringing the right people together around shared values.

My time living in Mexico for two years has shown me how communities form around values rather than geography. This journey led me to Network School, where I hope to find high agency, creative people to collaborate with.

I spend most of my time vibe coding with AI and focusing on my health and meditating. 

Core values: Freedom, Growth, Connection.

Interests: AI, crypto, vibe coding, frontier / startup societies, human-ai collaboration / intelligence augmentation, speaking new languages, future of user interfaces, history, philosophy. 

Currently studying with Math Academy to dive deeper into AI/ML. 

Hobbies: FOOD (ran a 900-person foodies group in CDMX), boxing, AI art, music.

✨**Tech**: I co-founded a green tech startup and worked as a consultant for Visa Crypto and later for a VC studio. I've been in crypto since 7 years and founded a web3 community in Barcelona in 2019, which scaled to about 1500 people, later I organized a festival around AI, web3 & futurism in Bcn. 🙂 The crypto world liberated me in more ways than one.

- Launched a protocol to use Bitcoin in smart contracts, currently with $100M+ in value locked
- Was an early employee at the company that invented the first use of zero knowledge proofs (which are now widely used to create privacy-preserving and scalable systems)
- Worked with governments around the US to research how crypto can create better systems and empower communities. 
- Built a financial literacy program to introduce New York students to the crypto industry.

While I’m at TNS, I’d love to work on building a platform for a Bitcoin-aligned network state. I believe a society built around sound money enables humanity to flourish and this is now possible through advancements in layer 2 technologies.

Three years ago, I got into Web3, and now I’m building Epic Web3—a global series of side events, hackathons, and conferences in ETH ecosystem across the USA, Asia, Europe, and beyond.

My big vision and dream ahead is to build a pop-up city—Oz City—focused on AI + Web3. I’d love to learn from the incredible minds at NS and contribute as well. Happy to learn and sweat!

I’ll be joining Network School on April 1st and super excited to be here! 

I just graduated from the University of Sydney and had worked as an ESG Analyst in Sydney and as a Private Equity Analyst in Shenzhen. Now, I’m focused on launching my own Tibetan incense brand and connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.

I’m also deeply passionate about yoga and Vipassana meditation, which have been transformative to me. Vipassana is a technique that helps bring the unconscious mind to the surface. As Goenka said, there are three kinds of thoughts: one is like ripples on the water, fleeting and temporary; another like a line drawn on the sand, easily washed away by the waves. But the third is an imprint carved into stone, lasting through time. This third kind is what’s stored deep in the iceberg of our unconscious mind, secretly influencing our behaviors—what we often call fate. Practicing Vipassana has been the greatest gift of the past year, and I hope to share this experience with others.

Also! I’ll be in Mt. Gambier for a Deep Week to get my Wave 2 certification, so I’ll be in Sydney/Melbourne from March 12-24. Catch me for a coffee if you're around!  Can’t wait to meet y’all.","['ESG Analyst', 'Finance', 'Meditation', 'Yoga']"

As a serial entrepreneur in this space, I’ve had the privilege of building innovative projects from the ground up, navigating the highs and lows of this dynamic industry. Alongside my entrepreneurial ventures, I’ve also been an active investor in the crypto space, always on the lookout for groundbreaking opportunities.

I’m thrilled to have joined Network School in March, and I’m deeply inspired by Balaji’s visionary concept of the Network State. I believe this idea has the potential to reshape the way we approach entrepreneurship, community-building, and innovation. It’s exciting to think about how we can apply these principles to create something truly impactful.

For me, entrepreneurship is all about turning ideas into reality—taking a concept from 0 to 1. It’s about solving real problems, challenging the status quo, and creating value for others. I’ve learned that success in this space requires resilience, creativity, and a willingness to learn from failures. I’d love to collaborate with like-minded individuals here to co-create, experiment, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

At Network School, I’m looking forward to embracing the ""Learn, Burn, Earn, and Fun"" mindset.

Bringing on a business partner to scale my company with me, so going to include that in my intro as it also intros me.

P.S. If this is breaking rules, sorry please delete. 🙂 

-------------------------

Hey guys - I’m building Relentless! We’re a fast-growing startup that’s revolutionizing the job search process with AI and Machine Learning—already @ 7 figures in revenue profitably in just a few years & growing quickly.

We’re looking for a Chief of Staff for a high-impact, cross-functional role working across marketing, sales, product, and engineering. This isn’t just an operational role; it’s a launchpad to a COO position at a company that’s already changing lives—helping job seekers land $50K+ salary bumps and even double their income.

Why this role is exciting:

🔥 Work directly with a Columbia-educated, ex-McKinsey founder who has sourced deals for investors behind Netflix, Tinder, and AngelList

📈 Scale an already successful cold email system from 50K to 100K+ weekly emails

💰 Help optimize tens of thousands of job applications per month to increase conversion rates and revenue

🚀 Fast-paced, high-growth environment with a clear path to COO

💡 Work with AI, automation, and cutting-edge growth strategies

Super open to having you work remotely, but there’s potential for relocation as the company scales. Compensation includes a significant commission-based component, ideal for someone hungry to grow and directly impact the company’s success & join me and my other business partners as we scale.

This doesn’t need experience, just RAW IQ, horsepower, and the desire to co-run a company that’s already crushing it.

131,,keo604,"**What I’m currently working on:**

• For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same—this is still ongoing and one of the main reasons I applied to NS.

• Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto—setting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.).

• Learning a lot about AI—both top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).

• Beginner Muay Thai learner—would love to take classes at NS. Anyone else interested in learning or teaching? Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, etc., are also on the table. Let’s connect!

  

**Network School**

I’ll be arriving in April, and my first project will be setting up a microschool/homeschooling community to make it easier for families to stay at NS for extended periods. The model will follow the **2-hour model / Alpha School approach**, where kids learn autonomously with AI tutors at their own pace—without human tutors for the basic core curriculum.


Next, the microschool would expand to afternoon sessions led by human coaches/mentors/motivators. Their role would be to help kids discover their passions, cultivate curiosity, and become 10x versions of themselves through human collaboration and AI. The focus would be on life skills, soft skills, and preparing for the future. The ultimate goal: involve kids in **building the future of society**—because it’s their future, and they should help shape it as soon as possible.
 

I hope to bootstrap this as quickly as possible. If you’re interested—whether you’re bringing kids, planning to stay long-term, or want to be involved—please reach out!
  

I’ll be at NS in April, then taking a short break before returning in June/July and staying until the end. My plan is to get the microschool up and running quickly so my family can join long-term next academic year—and to make it easier for other families to come. There’s no society without families and kids, so this will be my top priority.
  

I should probably put this intro on a website instead of dropping this wall of text here 😅
  

Anyway, excited to be here!

136,Barnabas,keo604,"Hey everyone,

I’m Barnabas, originally from Budapest, Hungary. I grew up as an expat kid in Algeria and have been living in Bali for the past three years.

I consider myself a builder, with a strong software engineering background—I started coding at five. I love solving problems that others think are unsolvable, with a strong emphasis on user experience. Growing up in Algeria and then in a post-Soviet country, I failed a lot and learned to crawl through broken glass to make it. I’m a cockroach, not a unicorn. A cockroach with a Liberland passport 🙂

I’m excited to join the Network School because I rarely meet like-minded individuals who are extreme risk-takers, fanatically love reimagining difficult problems from first principles, and embrace, learn from, and enjoy all the associated challenges.
 

**Things I value:**
• **Human connections** – Honesty, Empathy, Love
• **Self-sovereignty, Liberty** – NAP, Voluntarism
• **Spending time offline** – Enjoying the analogue waves
• **Building online** – Crunching digital bits
  

**Things I care about:**
• The future of society
• Posthumanism
• Everything that can be derived from the above two:
    • Detaching from the legacy system to become free, borderless, and crypto-native
    • Building a new societal blueprint
    • Safe superintelligence
    • Health, safe food, longevity, sports
    • 22nd-century education
    • Preparing for what’s to come in the next five years - and what's to come after

  
**A few fun things I’ve done:**

• Got together with a dozen people to create a community/village of like-minded techno-optimists. The project failed, but I learned a lot about biointensive farming—and it’s also where I discovered Bitcoin (this was in 2010). Back then, we used Bitcoin as money to trade veggies, land, labor, etc. No one thought of it as “HODL never spend digital gold.”

• Bootstrapped Hungary’s crypto ecosystem—[founded the first exchange/brokerage](https://mrcoin.eu) (since exited), launched ATMs (with a highly ranked central bank officer [praising Bitcoin at the inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDvEgqsbZow)😅), organized educational workshops, meetups, etc. Fun fact: We have the longest-running [Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.bitcoinbudapest.hu) in the world!

• Erected the first [Satoshi Statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/em74TdeSsbw?t=2363s) in Budapest, which became a pilgrimage site for crypto enthusiasts (and is now the default “Satoshi image” in the press).

• Built a small GPU rig to learn about mining—and it ended up mining Ethereum’s [genesis block](https://x.com/keo/status/1272844823834308608).

• Helped fund and bootstrap a pirate microschool/homeschooling club for my son 10 years ago because we couldn’t find any alternatives we were happy with. This later became a state-accredited [decentralized network of 18 microschools](https://budapestschool.org/en/) with 800+ students in Hungary.

I am a techno-optimist and have been working in Deep learning domain for ~6 years. Mostly I like to work either as freelancer, consultant,  remote jobs or on my own products and research ideas.

One reason I am particularly excited about network school is because I believe this is how communities and even nations of future should work. Grouping people based on their shared values and interests makes so much more sense than grouping based on geographical location of birth. 

Also, I believe that it's not just opportunity but also our responsibility to have a specific vision for the world we want to see when technology makes EVERYTHING possible because pre-internet era institutions won't survive post-AGI era.  IMO, one right direction would be to create a world of abundance and compassion for all biological beings. So far, it was Natural selection that helped in gene improvement but it also led to so much cruelty and suffering because it is based on scarcity of resources and zero sum competition. In world of abundance, we can just program genes and improve them in specific directions we want. All the species should be augmented with artificial intelligence and inter-species communication should be made possible so that planet earth actually becomes a much more healthy and happy place to live. 

Some projects I am exploring currently - 
- Possibility of test-time reasoning in spatial domain instead of just text domain. (Make models shape rotators rather than just wordcels).
- A better UI for LLMs using graphs instead of linear chats.

For the past two years, I’ve been traveling the world as a digital nomad, freediver, and explorer of the mind-body connection. I run a digital marketing business while also becoming a personal trainer and health coach. I love learning, moving, and discovering what makes us feel most alive.

I plan to contribute energy, joy, adventure, and a passion for self-discovery. Also, if you’ve never held your breath for two minutes before, I’ll prove you can. 😉

155,Elijah,ewilby,"Howdy y’all.

I’m Elijah. 29, from Houston, Texas. (I actually do say howdy and y’all unironically)

I’ve been a nerd ever since I received a breadboard for my 10th birthday. Been fixing hardware and cracking into my neighbors WEP “*secured*” WiFi since I was 13 since we couldn't afford working computers or internet. I got a job in networking when I was 18, and have since graduated the University of Houston with a BS in Computer Information Systems. Somewhere in between there I learned about crypto (I will only answer the question “*how*” over a Moutai) and I’ve been hooked for nearly the last 10 years.

In my day-job, I work at a global accounting firm where I teach professionals why they need to care about crypto and how it works. I also am in the process of scaling our blockchain community. I love what I do, but I’ll be taking a month off of that to come see what the Network School is all about in July.

After (*during*) work I also work on whatever side-projects I think would be fun, scalable, and make me a millionaire before 30 (I’ve got 9 months left). My favorite one right now is a Twitter page that automatically enhances and highlights AI art that I handpick, though it hasn't made me any money (yet). When I’m not doing that, I love to workout (actually hate it), walk in the sun, be at the beach, play basketball (big one), and win Marvel Rivals games (plat now, but just getting started).

I’m Ursula O’Kuinghttons, and my journey has always been about stories, whether it’s interviewing migrants searching for a new home or Heads of State shaping the future. I started in journalism at Prisa Media (Spain), covering major global events and expanding media across Europe, Spain and Latin America. But in 2012, I became fascinated by the idea that technology, specifically blockchain, could rebuild the media industry, making it more transparent, independent, and resilient. That curiosity led me to ConsenSys, where I was a founding member of Civil, one of the first attempts to decentralize journalism. Later, as Director of Communications and Partnerships at the Web3 Foundation in Switzerland, I helped to launchPolkadot. 

Now, as CMO of Scytale Digital VC and an advisor to Project Liberty (Frequency blockchain), I’m focused on building bridges between technology, media, and business. Project Liberty recently made a bid to acquire TikTok in the US with the goal of decentralizing it. We shall see how that unfolds, but the ambition is clear: put control back into the hands of users.
A few exciting things ahead: I’m organizing Decentralize Lugano, a finance-focused event in Switzerland, in May 8th, and I’ll also be at ETH Denver, where we’re hosting Frequency House, and Merge Buenos Aires, where I’ll be presenting a Web3 documentary on FC Barcelona, a project I’m proud to be part of.

Then, in 2013, my husband founded MrCoin, Hungary’s first Bitcoin exchange, and I was involved in that journey as well. <:bitcoin:1282286965794017280> It was incredibly exciting to introduce the then-unknown concept of Bitcoin to Hungary and to help build and educate the community around it. We organized Bitcoin film festivals, gave talks, and produced the Bitcoin segment for Hungary’s most well-known financial radio show weekly for many years. One of the highlights of this journey was unveiling the world’s first Satoshi statue in Budapest, which has since become a global symbol of Satoshi. We’re very proud of that! Fun fact: the statue was originally planned to have a hat, I was the one who convinced the team that the statue absolutely had to have a hood. 🙃 .  

I’m not a tech person by nature — I’m more interested in how technology and society influence each other. This applies to both cryptocurrencies and AI. I’m not so much focused on what happens at the code level, but rather how these innovations can be used for the benefit of humanity, maximizing their positive impact while minimizing potential risks. ❤️ ☮️ 🫂 

I have a deep passion for working with children. 💗 🚸 As a UNICEF volunteer for years, I helped run interactive workshops on children's rights and the realities of kids living in different parts of the world. I’m a Third Culture Kid (TCK), and my sons are as well, so I have extensive experience—both as a former TCK myself and now as a parent—on what it means to grow up across multiple countries. I understand the advantages and challenges of this lifestyle and how to enhance the positives while mitigating the difficulties. I even wrote a children's book on this topic, which won the ""Children’s Book of the Year"" award in Hungary in 2024. Additionally, I run educational Facebook groups in Hungary on topics like TCK kids, as well as women and AI. I am the co-founder of an indie book publishing company in Hungary called Zazie Books.

Beyond this, I have a background in journalism, political analysis, mediation, and coaching. I’m currently furthering my education to specialize in coaching children as well. 👩‍🎓 

My father was a member of Hungary’s first freely elected government after the fall of the communist regime, which gave me a deep insight from a young age into how a traditional nation-state operates. This, along with my legal background, makes it fascinating for me to rethink the role and function of the state from the ground up. This is one reason why I find NS so exciting. My husband and I also share a goal of creating a space, school, and workshops for the children of NS residents — ensuring they can grow and evolve alongside the adults. After all, while we’re trying to figure out what the future will look like, they are the ones who will live in it the longest, so I believe it's essential to involve them in shaping it. 🚀 

I have no harmful addictions—unless you count books, movies, and contemporary art and architecture... 😊

I’m really looking forward to getting to know all of you and would love to chat and exchange ideas on any of these topics. See you soon! 🙂 😍","['Artist', 'Children', 'Community Builder', 'Education', 'Education Reform', 'Humanity', 'Indie Filmmaking', 'Innovation', 'Politics', 'Sustainability', 'Technology Enthusiast']"

My experience includes investing in early stage companies, acquiring 3 companies on behalf of Galaxy, and building the investment banking team where our first big deal was selling Blockfolio to FTX in 2020. I've been involved with quite a bit of interesting deals over the years, including something relating to USDC's Circle, Mt Gox, and more, which I'll share over drinks 🙂

Currently Head of Finance and Partnerships at Mighty Bear Games, a Singapore-based Web3 gaming studio building GOAT Gaming, an AI-powered network of games on Telegram, where players can play games and win real money. I lead fundraising and strategic partnerships (ecosystems, exchanges, market makers etc).

At NS, I'm working with <@411984664245305354> <@326769551478095873> and <@1271312726357970976> on Network Smoothie (networksmoothie.com) which has been such a fun learning experience of building and optimising a TASTY and HEALTHY analog business 😇

325,Jim,jim_nomad,"Hi, this is Jim, I am excited to return to Forest City Network School for most of its final month and grateful to Balaji & NS team for the learning opportunity.

I’m Chinese-American from Midwest but mostly exited the US since around 10 years ago, first moving to Brasil and then now in Southeast Asia in the Philippines. Got two young sons who I hope to be netizens of network societies in the future. For much of my life, I’ve tried to as a neutral avoid collateral damage from the escalating US-China conflict, but the “curse” somehow always comes back — most recently in the form of nearly monthly South China Sea scares near the Philippines (which could rock the entire Indo-Pacific region) and fears of return of McCarthyism by US/US “vassals” (not so much about the “anti-Communist” part but concerns rooted in the potentially unfair and unethical targeting of particular minority disapora groups). 

I am thankful for the frameworks that Balaji has envisioned - for it gives me hope that milions of neutrals, nomads, migrants, third-culture-kids, etc can try to find peaceful independent alternate paths for themselves and their families — hopefully peacefully independent from clutches of legacy nation states that have power to commit violence, confiscation, cancellation, suspicion, persecution, and shaming of those accused of being not “nationalistic/patriotic” enough or accused of not loving “democracy” enough. 

Hoping for a future in which my kids and others in their generation would no longer be judged or limited by the color of their passport/national id/social security card. (Nowadays, to be born, to go to school, to get employed, to travel globally, to get married, to have kids, to retire, and even to die and pass on inheritance — one would need recognition from a nation state!). Nothing against nation states, respecting them, just seeking peaceful alternatives.

I look forward to learning from everyone — it is a blessing to connect with and learn from so many thinkers, innovators, entreprenuers, and aspiring network state/network society netizens in this community. I am humbled to have the chance to learn — and I hope to continue to come back to Forest City from time to time. A big thanks to Balaji and the NS team for making things happen.

I've been in the crypto space for 3 years now and love talking about tech, society, opensource, monetary policies, history,decentralization. How do we create new decentralized platforms, new community currencies and in the end new states? I'm mostly aligned with the cyberpunk ethos so in this search for meaning in the crypto sea, I spent some time in 

 - the ReFI (regenerative finance) space, trying to put a value on nature. I'm very interested in the food industry and how it could be improved
- governance and more recently futarchy: governance by the markets. It's been a pretty interesting path of thinking for me
- i'm learning about cryptography, zk and privacy. It's time to focus on this before everything is traceable

I'm currently building an app called ascend https://x.com/ascend_sh : an accountability social network that lets you stake and bet on the completion of a routine or a task with your friends. Could be sport, pushing commits on github, twetting more, anything. It's still very early and we plan to launch soon, would love to do some user interviews with you guys.

Also attended Vitalia / Prospera this past February, met a bunch of the folks in the movement and had a great experience.

I wanted to formally introduce myself as I won't be able to attend the conference and the first 2 weeks - I'll be at a friend's wedding and will join you all on October 4. I am fascinated by Network States and grateful for the work the NS team has done to put this together. My FOMO is at an all-time high missing the first bit!

I'm Shar from Vancouver. My entrepreneurial background spans multiple industries including agrichemicals, cannabis, real estate, entertainment, and some tech (an area I'm hoping to expand on). I've worked on pre-IPO capital raises, advised startup founders, and served on a co-op board (lots of parallels with web3). I thrive in project-based sprints, working with small, motivated teams to solve exciting problems. 

I'm coming off a six-year sprint building and exiting a cannabis company. The past year has been exploratory, focusing on new ways of work and refining not just what I want to work on, but how.
Themes of particular interest: 
-Digital products and apps
-Audience-first building
-AI-driven low-cost development
-Projects beyond excessive regulatory scrutiny -[as Balaji discusses regarding the administrative state](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWMcRRkuak>)

These align with my belief that smaller teams can do high-leverage work (@naval speaks about this a lot -[see page 60 of the Almanack of Naval Ravikant](<https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf>). Long-term, I aim to build skills and a network for a venture studio-type model, creating tasteful projects for people with audiences (yes, this could be a DAO, my crypto friends).

NS couldn't have come at a better time. Inspired by [Levelsio's 12 projects in 12 months](<https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>), my goal is to collaborate on ""indie hacker"" type projects. Instead of solo development, multiple people with domain expertise building, testing, and launching projects quickly. See what fails or gains traction, focusing on building for or with an audience. I have a few projects I've been building with my own network but would be cool to build with some likeminded NS admits -would be extra cool to look at projects we could build for the NS community!

Other than that I spend most of my time learning and investing exclusively in longevity startups. My fund is called Immortal Dragons (https://id.life). Fun fact is that I also received the Minicircle Follistatin Gene Therapy. Had to fly to Prospera, Honduras to receive it.

Joining the Network School feels like it's the ""connecting the dots"" moment in my life!

I’m 22 years old and have been homeschooled since I was 10. In 2019, I founded China’s only homeschooler community. The desire to see the community achieve prosperity through emergence led me to explore organizational development, which is how I recognize DAO. Once my anarchist spirit met crypto, there was no turning back.

Over the past five years, I’ve been involved in over 100 projects without attending college. About 30% didn’t fail, and 3% were a big success. Last year, as a digital nomad at Zuzalu, I began to wonder why college couldn’t be nomadic, prove yourself with portfolio instead of diploma?

I tried to bring this idea to life with hundreds of co-creators and got $206,000 in pledged donations, but everything was shut down by the Political Security Bureau in China. I nearly ended up in jail. They feared the education for freedom and the infiltration through crypto investment.

After that, I realized it was time to leave China and build on a global scale. So when I saw the Network School, I know it's where I should come.","['Alternative Education', 'DAO', 'Decentralized Governance', 'Digital Nomad', 'Crypto', 'Community Building', 'Anarchism']"

My name is Max Kordek. My specialization is in technology, crypto and futurism. In crypto since nearly 13 years, founder since 8 years when it all started with Lisk for which I collected 14,000 BTC in 2016.

I founded:

- Onchain Foundation, a non-profit crypto venture builder and research institute
- Lisk, originally a JavaScript L1, now a L2 part of Optimism’s/Base’s Superchain
- Pass App, a smart wallet using account abstraction
- Lightcurve, Berlin’s longest-standing blockchain agency

I’m a big advocate of the idea behind network states, and I’m big into health and longevity. After being at Bryan Johnson’s house last week, it became apparent to me that I need to dive much deeper into technology and longevity! Therefore, the Network School sounds like the perfect opportunity for me! 


My intention is to stay on the island for the entire time (only being away for short business trips in October and November), while being there I’d like to challenge myself and build a small project from scratch, get physically super-fit, and soak up as much knowledge from the school and participants as possible.

A little bit about myself:
- Caught the ""software is eating the world"" bug in 2008 while I was surrounded by finance/consulting junkies back in college (😅  at me potentially being one of the older members in our cohort) 
- Thankful to have learnt about BTC also while in college, with a bright orange bitcoin ATM in our college lobby
- Went down the rabbit hole when 2017''s early wave of ICOs began

Excited to join NS because:
- I’ve had several moments in my life when financial constraints prevented me from pursuing opportunities beyond Singapore. Witnessing how stronger financial resources opened doors for my peers to globally renowned opportunities, which in turn led to even more, was a major reality check for me.

- This experience fueled my 'chip on my shoulder' to create and pursue global opportunities, even while being homebound

- It also cemented my strong belief in crypto as the decentralized and open financial system of our generation, allowing me to work alongside global talent, regardless of where we’re based.

Lately, though, I’ve started feeling jaded by the PvP nature of our crypto space. I’m looking forward to my time in NS to meet fresh faces, reignite my enthusiasm for the industry, and cut through the noise.

**Why I'm Excited About the Network School**
I’m thrilled to be part of the Network School because the idea of the Network State represents a pivotal leap in the evolution of democracy. Moreover, it’s not just where the world is headed; it's a blueprint for accelerating our most ambitious endeavors.

The Network State seems like our best hope at creating a bedrock for true progress, reshaping possibilities not to not just only sovereignty, but also the human superpower of cooperation, and unencumbered innovation across diverse spheres (e.g., catalyzing breakthroughs like the gene therapies emerging in Próspera, Honduras).

As William Gibson famously depicted in his cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, cyberspace is: *“a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation.” *

**And together we can make nations synonymous with networks!**

2. Develop my perspective on the most promising opportunities to **leverage blockchain as a social technology**.
3. Be in the best physical, mental, and spiritual shape of my life. **Shoutout Blueprint**! Also excited to be around so many experienced meditators, I was not expecting that.
4. **Develop new skills.** I’ve been learning-on-the-job for the past 8 years — I’m excited for a slightly more structured approach to “continuous education”.
5. **Work on inspiring projects with amazing people from around the world.**

**🔧 Things I’m interested in building:**
**1. Personal Productivity Systems & Utilities.** I’m interested in structures that help people design-and-operate their life. From the lowest level todo lists to the highest level aspirations and vision boards. I’m still sitting in the question of how AI advancements can transform how we design our lives and get things done.
**2. Blueprint.** Making any aspects of the Blueprint protocol more accessible to consumers.
**3. Burning Man.** I’m coming fresh out of Burning Man and have some ideas. Is it possible to create a Blueprint-friendly Burning Man experience? Could blockchain-enabled devices / crypto-secured hardware be used to collect community feedback in a way that’s transparent and community-owned?
**4. What are you building!?** Nothing gets me more excited than other people’s passion to bring something into the world.

Broadly, I’m a pretty curious person. But to highlight some specific hobbies & interests: surfing, yoga, weight lifting, guitar, local-first software, tools for thought, consciousness, and community building. Would love to learn more meditation, dance, acroyoga.","['Community Builder', 'AI', 'Software Development', 'Blockchain', 'Tech Community', 'Digital Products']"

As <@360908616536031235> beautifully put it, ""We are all here because we are all risk-takers who are not afraid to try something new."" That resonates deeply with me. 💪

I'm an aspiring tech enthusiast and entrepreneur from Singapore 🇸🇬, still finding my way in the world of startups and technology. My journey has been a mix of successes and failures - I've had 3 startups that didn't make it, managed to sell 1, and now I'm working on building another. 

Currently, I'm working remotely for a crypto company, where I'm juggling various roles - from providing technical support and troubleshooting blockchain issues to developing automated systems with Python. 🖥️🔧 It's a constant learning experience! Alongside this, I'm also building a new business with AI, exploring the exciting possibilities in this field. 🤖 But I'm very much a beginner in these areas, eager to learn from all of you who have such impressive backgrounds.

One personal challenge I've set for myself is marathon running. 🏃‍♂️ I'm training for my 4th marathon, aiming for a sub-4 hour timing. It's a goal I set 5 years ago and haven't achieved yet, but I'm using it as a way to teach myself persistence and not giving up on goals we set. Any running buddies?

At Network School, I'm here primarily to learn. I'm excited about the concept of network states and how we might create transformative projects, but I know I have so much to absorb from all of you. I'm ready to soak up knowledge about tech, entrepreneurship, personal growth, and especially about setting up new societies and governance models. 🌐🏗️ It's a fascinating area I'm keen to explore further.

I'm looking forward to learning from all of you, contributing where I can, and growing together in this exciting journey. Let's create something extraordinary! 🚀","['Crypto', 'Entrepreneur', 'Tech Community', 'Software Development', 'Running', 'Decentralized Governance']"

and I’m on a mission to revolutionize the clothing industry through technology and community building.

Inspired by the devastating impact of mass production and overconsumption, I went a year without buying clothes, leveraging my community to raise awareness. Now, I’m building a platform that enhances the social fabric of network states through fashion health (microplastic/chemical-free clothing) and trading.

Deeply involved in art, biohacking for women, natural health solutions, and fashion circularity. I believe that nature holds many of the answers we seek. I’m also a content creator on these topics and work in marketing for tech startups. In the NS School, I’m looking to dive deep into the world of crypto, coding, and leadership.

I'm coming to NS because I'm looking for a community with a vision. I'm interested in future societies built to accommodate frontier technology like life extension, AGI, diverse intelligence and space exploration. At a time when all this is on the horizon, the West feels increasingly negative and backward-looking, and I'm no longer convinced it is the right environment for these ideas to flourish. Something new is needed to bring together people who still believe in the future, and I hope that NS can be the seed.

I'm a developer/designer hybrid, and I'm currently bootstrapping a new project in AI narrative media/simulations.

I'm Björn, of Swedish origin as you might assume. I spent most of my formative years in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, at 23 years old, I find myself living in Spain, which presents an interesting contrast to my background and beliefs.

**|Current Projects|**
**Building a decentralized water utility**
I'm incredibly excited to be attending the network school with my partner. Balaji's network state thesis is at the core of my startup's vision: I'm building a decentralized water utility for network states, currently focused on Latin America. We aim to lower economic barriers to clean water access through reimagined core infrastructure and ownership models.

(By the way, anyone have contacts in El Salvador? 😜)

**EU/accelerationism podcast**
Living in Spain is conflicting for me. It's challenging being a pro-capitalist, small-government kind of guy in this environment. However, I've channeled this challenge into action:

1. I've established a substantial chapter of the EU/ACC movement through strong local business communities.
2. I started a podcast where we stream on X/twitter Spaces, amplifying voices from a network of local live players. We've already reached over 600 attendees in our first stream.

I tend to sway pessimistic about Europe's current trajectory, but I’m determined to spark honest conversations about it and empower live players who can actually make a change. 

**|Personal Interests|**
While I enjoy fitness, music, and playing guitar, above ALL I find myself irresistibly drawn to the mysteries of ancient civilizations, a passion that permeates every aspect of my life and intellectual growth.

I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and continuing to work towards innovative solutions in both the digital and physical realms.

Some things that I enjoy doing:
* Being physically active (I love kettlebell and bodyweight training)
* Reading classic and nonfiction books
* Researching investment ideas
* Programming
* Living in walkable cities 

Something interesting about me is I have a pilot’s license and come from a family of pilots. 

I spent a good portion of my 20s at an IT consulting firm working on software projects at large companies and experienced the guts of corporate America. In 2021, after feeling unfilfilled and alienated by the corporate culture, I resigned to focus on stock & crypto investing and tinkering with projects.

Fitness has been part of my life since I was 15. I'm a kettlebell enthusiast. I also want to try new forms of exercise while on the island, especially yoga and stretching because I have skipped that more or less ha.

I'm coming to NS because Balaji’s idea of a network state has always excited me. The moment I saw his post about NS and read '""We got an island"" I applied ha. It was a no-brainer. I'm grateful to have the freedom to do something like this on short notice.

522,André,fakedavinxi,"Hey everyone, I’m André. Can’t wait to join this experience

I was born in the far north of Sweden, by the Arctic Circle. Some say I’m half Viking half Sámi.

I was never motivated by authority so I always found school quite boring. I still went to university studying computer science and business for a dual degree. It mostly felt like a waste though and I spent most time learning following my own curiosity.

Since then I started a digital agency building POC for startups, developed a titanium-based DJ headphone used by top DJs like Diplo and Skrillex, co-founded a record label, built a cabin village in the mountains and co-founded a technology company developing AI models for automating valuation of real estate assets and opening up single-family homes at scale as a new asset class for institutional investors. 

Since my days in school I've been thinking about how demotivating the education system is. Academia is killing creativity and the joy of learning with its assembly line methods. I want to encourage students to dive straight into building at the edges of progress, without waiting for an academic diploma as a stamp of approval at the cost of your soul. I’m exploring a medium combining crypto, digital art, animated video and gaming, infused with our deepest knowledge. This is where my focus is now and Network States seems like the perfect place to apply it.   

I like to read widely, produce (mostly electronic) music, design houses, take long walks and think about how the world works. I’m always drawn to the intersection of art and technology and learning about the frontier of innovation in various fields. My goal at NS is to meet like-minded people who want to replace dysfunctional institutions and build better environments for optimism to flourish.

My life -
- In crypto since 2014, and always believe it’s not a game about money. I agree with Balaji in so many ways especially when it comes to future of the humanity, but it might take so many years or even generations for things to start moving (I guess that’s why we are learning to live longer or simply don’t die in this school)
- Did my undergrad in the US and learned English
- Previously a journalist based in Washington D.C. reporting on world politics
- Switched to producing/directing stand-up comedy shows in China. Show biz in China is weirdly fun!
- Now a full-time writer, also run a travel agency focusing on tours in South East Asia 

What I can provide to NS (just did a little brainstorming)
- I make Chinese food and hot pot. If food is too healthy in NS, I’ll try to cook and share food. Not sure if we’ll have access to a decent kitchen, but we are close to a modern civilization (Singapore), so I’m sure we can figure something out
- I take people to Bali all the time. I’m like half a local, so if you need tips/recommendations, hey (waving hands)
- I directed & produced quite a few stand-up shows, podcasts & talk shows. I like talking to and interviewing people. And here obviously we see so many interesting people with fantastic life stories - I read through everyone’s intro and already have so many questions to ask. If you are also interested in producing something creative during your time in NS, let’s chat! Happy to exchange ideas / collaborate

I always was interested in libertarian principles and looking for a truly meritocratic, free community. Back in 2015, I was one of the early visitors to Liberland, what should have been a new, libertarian micronation, but did not work out.

I first bought one Bitcoin in 2013 for €100 in cash, back then I was looking for a privacy-focused way to pay online. Back then it was just one option on a long list next to paysafecard, VCCs, and prepaid cards, but crypto quickly became something I really care about for freedom and state-resistance.

Today, I run Lendorse, a startup that helps finance talented but underprivileged students from developing and emerging countries to study STEM MSc programs in Europe. There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, because I’ve become increasingly skeptical about Europe's future.

I’m very interested in longevity. I see death as the final enemy and find it crazy how indifferent society is to it. I’ve started my own ""Bryan light"" longevity protocol, with regular blood tests and various supplements, but I still struggle with sleep discipline and maintaining a good diet and hope for the peer pressure of the program.

Professionally, I studied economics and business at LSE and St. Gallen. After a couple of years at McKinsey, I left the corporate world and have been in the startup ecosystem ever since (TradFi & Logistics).

I'm a software developer building a decentralized code collaboration platform for open source development with my longtime friend and co-founder, Parth (he is also part of the program). I've always been fascinated by programming and its power to bring ideas to life. It's much more accessible compared to other careers where specialized instruments or capital are required for research. In comparison, we only need a laptop and an internet connection to conduct experiments; our ideas are the only limitation.

I started working with Parth in 2019. I had just left my 3-year stint at a tech startup and was taking a break to learn about machine learning, blockchain, and other emerging technologies. I still vividly remember the first time I sat down with Parth as he explained the concept behind cryptocurrencies and their practical applications, convincing me to work with him. More than the financial and speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, I was excited about the power to create micro-economies and incentives that could easily mobilize people across the world to work towards common goals. After that, we never looked back, and I've learned a lot both professionally and personally.

Just read the Innovators (Walter Isaacson) and inspired by the way it portrays innovation as a team activity powered by cross-disciplinary skills so I'm hoping to explore some collaborations and learning from each other.

568,Da aka Rida aka OctoQueenz,octoqueenz,"Hey Everyone! 

My name is Da aka Rida aka OctoQueenz (in Web3). Born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. Eye-opening in the US, adulting in Canada, and reborn in the UAE. I’ve been living a nomadic life for the past couple of years, mostly between Dubai and Bangkok. 

In 2013, I quit my corporate job as a Mechanical Engineer with $500 in my pocket to travel the world and ended up in Toronto. That’s when I first heard about Bitcoin, and since then I got hooked and slid right into the rabbit hole. 

Thanks to my degree, which is useless overseas, gave me the chance to explore and experiment with countless opportunities life has to offer, from waiting tables, bartending, real estate investing, and photography, to content creation and running my own restaurant, which got featured in multiple local Canadian media and became one of the top takeout spots in Toronto during the pandemic. 

I lived in 6 different countries (soon to be 7 with Forest City!) across 4 continents and visited 65+ countries/territories. I’ve come to realize that no country is perfect, it’s only perfect for you at a specific time in your life and (almost) all governments are the same. 

I’m heavily invested in Web3, starting with DeFi and then NFTs during the Pandemic. Together with my husband (who will also be attending NS), we launched an indie gaming studio specializing in Metaverse games and are also building an online learning platform.

I’ve been interested in longevity since 2019, when I first read Dr. Sinclair’s Lifespan and have been using Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint products plus attending events like the VitaDAO DeSci Summit and the Akshay Summit in Dubai, where <@777003807279677500>  was a speaker. I remember thinking, “Great events like this should be longer!” and here we are “The Network School!”

I'm Johnathon Lang. 

I’m a combat veteran, and I do my best to promote peace, health, and embodiment. I’ve worked as a coach and facilitator in Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas.

My journey has taken me across domains and terrains: from the Pocono Mountains to Baghdad, NYC, Shanghai, and now, to the regenerative rhythms of the Colombian jungle.

Since 2019, I’ve been deeply involved with Zafra Nature Reserve, a Colombian community initiative in eco-tourism, eco-education and bioregional regeneration. From here I lead Natural Movement retreats for international participants, run MovNat teacher training certifications across the Americas, and maintain an online and in-person embodiment coaching practice.

In addition to MovNat, some of the other health and fitness organizations I’ve worked and certified with include:
-Animal Flow
-The CHEK Institute (Paul Chek) 
-StrongFirst
-CrossFit HQ
-Just Yoga
-El Barrio Boxing NYC
-Ecstatic Dance 上海 (Shanghai)

In 2020, I found Balaji’s work, and it was a signal in the noise.

His early clarity on the shifts brought by COVID in tech, politics, and economics was unmatched, giving glimpses into a future that many had yet to see. I was further inspired by his first public chat with Tim Ferriss, so I followed deeper into his Network State vision—creating beautiful new worlds from the debris of burning old worlds.

I’ve been on the periphery of crypto and AI for the last couple of years. I’m beyond “interested” and before “proficient.”

I have a lot to learn from you all and hopefully as much to give.

My professional background is in sales and marketing, and I currently lead growth for a startup cybersecurity company. I’ve been working remotely between Mexico, Argentina, and Indianapolis for the last couple of years.

Some of the activities that give me the most pleasure include:
- Reading, writing, thinking
- Training and competing (weightlifting, Muay Thai, CrossFit)
- Scuba diving and downhill skiing
- Meditation (beginner, Vipassana)
- Spending time with friends and family with nowhere to be

I’ve always dreamed of starting a “win and help win” community of positive people seeking a better way to live.

I’m Hugo Faz, performance artist and filmmaker originating from grassroots queer communities, long time cultural agitator, anti-censorship advocate and art collector based in São Paulo, Brazil, fully involved with crypto and NFTs since early 2021. The moment I read Balaji’s announcement of the Network School I knew I was meant to attend, even before reading the term ""latin-american libertarians""!

Since getting to know and aligning with punk6529’s vision for an open metaverse, I became fully invested – time and money – in building our decentralized future. Not only I was one of the first Meme Artists to create for 6529’s project (https://seize.io/the-memes/30), I am also one of the biggest collectors of 6529's The Memes — which have just been revealed as the fundamental building blocks for a  practically functioning Network State — and among the highest reputed members of their network (https://seize.io/hugofaz).

I have been collecting culturally relevant NFTs not just for myself but also for Casa NUA (https://en.nft.nua.casa), the southern hemisphere’s first permanent IRL Museum for Decentralized Art, which I founded in 2023 in the heart of São Paulo, and which now holds regular exhibitions of art minted as NFTs, culturally educating a new generation of artists, collectors and enthusiasts.

But besides all of the above, the Burn pillar of NS hit me even harder. Having my father diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s Disease in 2015 got me since embarked on a personal journey to optimize my physical (and thus my brain’s) health and gain as much longevity as I can to keep building and seeing flourish our shared envisioned future of peace, freedom [to transact] and knowledge. I have recently began using my social platform on Instagram  (https://instagram.com/hugofaz) to share this health journey daily and inspire others to do the same for themselves, becoming a health and fitness influencer of sorts, while also relying on my follower community to discipline myself.

Solo travel became one of my favorite hobbies, with adventures in ~30 countries. My view on life is it’s the most realistic MMORPG, with each new location/role as the next level, full of trials to overcome. Other hobbies include flying drones, reading, trading, hiking, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.

Artists and digital nomads influenced my philosophy about work and purpose, particularly around untethering oneself from a physical location while contributing to an aligned tribe.

As for work, I’ve played different roles such as a medical imaging researcher, soul-sucking fortune 500 company intern, AP/IB science and math teacher at international schools, bizdev co-founder for a Xiaohongshu (Chinese Instagram) based travel agency, co-founder of a memecoin market/social analytics website, growth hacker at a Y Combinator backed startup, creator of a Zoom based web3 introductory course.

From the age of 10, I immersed myself in books daily.

At 14, I formed a group of friends around skateboarding. Together, we financed and constructed a skatepark in our village. This early taste of community building and bringing an idea to life fueled my ambitions.

At 19, I created a YouTube channel called 'People Of'. It quickly gained traction in the music scene, generating millions of views every month. It allowed me to earn my first internet money, empowering me to drop out of law school in Bordeaux and relocate to Paris.

At 21, I began exploring Augmented Reality, creating AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat. My Instagram filters rapidly made half a billion views. Facebook (now Meta) invited me to their London HQ. There, I connected with fellow creators and the Facebook team behind the Spark AR software, further expanding my horizons.

Currently, I'm passionate about 3D filmmaking in real-time, a cutting-edge technique using the power of Unreal Engine 5. This technology allows for near-instantaneous 3D rendering (unlike traditional 3D softwares that demands huge rendering time or access to costly render farms).
I believe we're on the edge of a paradigm shift, where small teams can create cinematic experiences capable of captivating millions while generating significant revenue. This is where I'm now focusing my energy, alongside my interests in AI, cryptocurrency, and philosophy.

My name is Parth (30 years old), I am from India originally. I started my journey by dropping out of college and searching my path. I love technology and did freelancing for a long time before entering crypto. I ran a service company for a while before building a decentralized Github. 
As AI is changing everything, I  am working on another challenging idea that builds on top of it.

I love dogs and had a German shepherd for 10 years (passed away last year). He was something that grounded me in India so after that, I moved to wherever opportunities took me. I stay between India, Thailand and Dubai now.

I love that so many people here are into meditation, it’s amazing. Meditation changed my life. I started from the Vipassana retreat in Koh Phangan, thailand where I got my first experience which I couldn’t give words to and got hooked immediately. Post that I spent 8 months meditating in a retreat in India while working remotely. This restructured my understanding of spirituality and awareness.
I have also dabbed with longevity (food, medicines and fasting)  and seen dramatic changes that the body and mind have when done strictly.

Network School is an amazing opportunity and I intend to make the most of it. So anyone here needs some guidance/help in technology, development, crypto, or AI, don’t hesitate to reach out. Meanwhile, I definitely need help with marketing myself and what I build (I feel I am not so great at it) and also working out( I have never been a regular gym goer)

641,Rajat,rkluthra,"Hello! My name is Rajat(https://x.com/r_k_luthra), Me & my wife Neha, are deeply honoured to be joining the Network School amongst all you rockstars. I have a background in the jewelry industry in India as a designer/entrepreneur. Last year, I was introduced to Farcaster, and since then, I’ve had the opportunity to design for several web3 communities. I’ve found a deep connection with some, like Nouns Dao, where I’m currently building jewelry collections & developing a Nounish jewelry brand that integrates their various communities.

I’m also working on a transmedia storytelling brand that spans a novel series, films, a jewelry brand, and games. My aspiration is to empower people by gamifying spiritual & martial arts techniques from diverse cultures worldwide, using emerging technologies like AR/VR. I’m pursuing programs in game design, AI filmmaking and film editing, at the side, to be a creator in these emerging mediums.

I’m excited to see meditators here, I have had experiences with a few techniques. I’ve also trained in multiple martial arts like Capoeira, BJJ, Krav Maga, etc. and have been passionate about CrossFit. Would love to explore training & meditating together. 

My life has been a quest for community—a sangha, as Buddha would say—a group of like-minded souls united by a shared purpose & now to be part of this cohort feels surreal. From running 90 day hackathons across writing, fitness, spirituality, startups, with two friends some years back, to actually being part of the most interesting 90 day cohort on the planet, under a teacher and visionary like Balaji, I’m in awe of how life can sometimes answer your deepest dreams. Thanks <@777003807279677500> for dreaming this dream, for manifesting this dream & for selecting a ‘dark talent’ like me.

I’m sure this is the start of many new journeys, conversations, friendships, communities & network states. Let’s make it happen!","['Artist', 'Creator Economy', 'Martial Arts', 'Game Development', 'Meditation', 'Community Builder', 'Network Society', 'Decentralized Communities']"

Hyped to be here (like everyone reading this!) 

I'm Valentin (or valeyo / https://x.com/valeyo777), 25 years old, born and raised in Germany to a Bulgarian Mother and a half Russian / half Ukrainian Father! I'm the Founder of Quasar (quasar.fi), a crypto DeFi project whose entire focus is to aggregate and abstract away everything that sucks about DeFi so that people like my parents can benefit from the digital revolution. We were fortunate enough to raise more than $11M Dollars to make it happen, so hopefully I can help some of y'all on the crypto side with your raising and capital acquisition goals. 

I also have a DAO of angel investors called BaseDao (basedao.org). We're a group of founders and crypto natives that focus on keeping the fun vibes alive in a space thats increasingly cynical about making money in sacrifice of fun. 

Generally my never-ending love for freedom came from being banned on Paypal for trying to buy Apple Stock at 12 years old and having to pay a massive fine for that (really radicalized me to democratizing access). I dropped out of college (Philosophy) and visited Draper University (an entrepreneurship residency program in Silicon Valley founded by Tim Draper), following that I've been founding 2 startups, with Quasar being the biggest one so far.

So thrilled to be here. I'm Kris, and I've been in crypto since 2017 – it's been an amazing journey! I have strong skills in marketing campaigns and community growth and have worked for some of the top blockchain projects before. 

I love experiencing new protocols and new projects and getting involved in all the new trending narratives! I've had the pleasure of using, buying, and researching thousands of crypto projects! They cover a whole range of areas, from DeFi, NFT, gaming, and social dApps to AI, DePin, memecoins, and various new blockchains. I am an individual investor now and enjoy communicating thoughts on the market and all the exciting new projects with friends.

I'm currently working on a tool that will assess the capabilities of crypto KOLs and assist retail users in making more informed investment decisions. I'm not an experienced developer, but I'm learning fast with the help of AI! If anyone would like to build with me, feel free to talk to me.

652,Jangle,defijangle,"Howdy! 👋 

Jangle here. I’m a DeFi power user.

I’m all about using cutting-edge onchain apps & infrastructure, understanding DeFi on a deep level, and educating others.

Since 2021 (just after defi summer), I’ve been very active onchain. The onchain economy was growing, so I left my big4 IT Risk job and joined a venture capital syndicate investing in early stage DeFi projects. 

I built relationships with many of our LPs & became their go-to for everything onchain.

When the venture syndicate wound down, I doubled down on DeFi and built a company selling research. We covered projects like Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Aave, Maker, GMX, Jupiter, Curve, and more. 

Recently, I’ve stepped back from that company, and my gf and I have been digital-nomad style traveling in SE Asia. 

Skills I’m leveling up at NS (**learn**):
1. **Onchain data analysis**.  Extracting insights from onchain data. 
2. **Financial analysis**. Building financial models for digital assets. 
3. **Programming**. Building onchain apps, ensuring security, and plugging onchain data into financial models.  
4. **Systems Design**. Building sustainable, secure, and scalable onchain apps that minimize/eliminate governance risk.
5. **Content creation**. Providing value beyond my existing client base, promoting NS builders and community members to the broader world, and helping educate others at scale to reduce onchain fraud, theft, and malinvestment. 

My favorite **burn** activities are weightlifting and Muay Thai. 

To anyone here who is not an onchain power users or developer: If you have any questions or want practical blockchain/DeFi knowledge feel free to reach out, tag me, or DM. I love being useful to anyone who wants to use** onchain apps**. There is no question to basic or silly. 

I’m 26yrs old. Born in Louisiana, raised in Alabama (rural states in the Southern USA 🇺🇸 ). 

Humbled to be here. WAGMI

654,,nicovrg,"Hi fellow students & builders! 

I'm in my late 20s, I view myself as very libertarian / cypherpunk and vibing with that type of people is what got me in crypto a while ago. I learned to code in a p2p school (42) where there was no teacher, the building was open 24/7, there was a skilltree of project with branches depending what area of computer science you want to explore and you got graded by other students and the school test scripts. I've also a deep passion for economy, I think I have more than 10k hours trying to figure out how the system works but I still have a lot to figure out 

In crypto right now I focus on the solana ecosystem. I've contributed with my girlfriend to metadao, the futarchy experiment on solana that's doing great and we hacked a mobile app for the last colosseum hackathon that let you challenge yourself / your friends to do stuff for example build in public or tweet more often etc ... and you get slash if you don't do it. For the next colosseum hackathon we're thinking about reusing some of that app building blocks to build a conflict resolution / justice system for dao & network states

I’m super excited to meet all of you! My name is Esther, I’m a 30 year old from the Netherlands. 

My background is in international law, I’ve studied both human rights law and tax law. Currently I’m working for a small international bank from the Netherlands where I am an international tax manager, mainly involved with the investment fund side of our company. However, I’m looking to change my career to something else, although I’m not yet quite sure what exactly. It is also still unclear whether I can continue this job remote, so I might have to quit (please tell me I’m not crazy) which I’ll then see as the trigger to actually start something else.

On that note, I’ve been learning to program, but I’m still on a very beginner level. I am also interested in anything crypto, AI and web3, I’m definitely not an expert yet but I’ve already learned quite a bit of the basics from my partner (who will join the NS as well!), and looking forward to keep learning about all this at the NS. 

Outside of the work sphere I love travelling (just spend 6 months in South America), playing board games, learning new things, and I am a health enthusiast, following Blueprint for a while now.

663,Colton,oldkiraicoal,"Hi everyone! I'm Colton, a jack of all trades mechanical engineer working in the HVAC/Plumbing side of the construction industry in the SF Bay area. Stoked to meet you all and connect!

I've been playing with an idea similar to The Network State based on the idea of creating and decentralizing open-source blueprints for factories (ideally employee owned) that would manufacture (as autonomously as possible) products that would themselves automate (as much as possible) the handling of people's needs. The idea being to give people on the ground the tools to come together and build the infrastructure to take care of themselves. 

Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the foundational level covers Food, Water, & Shelter. Then beyond that level: Health, Education, and Security. So for example the solution set for ""shelter"" could look like a blueprint for a factory that cranks out unfolding shipping container houses. 

My hobbies/interests include music (guitar, piano), travel (spent two years in Asia), amateur ancient history, survival skills, philosophy, spirituality, amateur biology, etc. 

I don't know nearly enough about actually using the Blockchain, but I definitely appreciate a number of its potentials and can't wait to learn all about it. Similarly excited to learn about web3, AI, etc.

First business at 16. Failed 5 times before my first success in the Web3 Space as a project founder. Worked on building a game and eventually failed due to my own lack of technical knowledge necessary. Of course, all of these are not failures but huge learning lessons. Did consultancy & advisory for several firms before exploring the world of angel investing & venture capital. I love building businesses that bring huge value. Big believer in the future of crypto & web3. 

**My Goal** for entering the Network School to **learn**, **build new relationships** and **earn**. I'm in a stage in my life where my sole goal is to level up. To surround myself with the brightest minds and brainstorm then execute huge ideas. I'm in a bit of a lull period where I'm preparing myself for the next crazy venture/business in my life.

I love creating content, and I will create a ""Network State Journey"" series documenting our daily lives, activities and experiences. **Fellow content creators** or those interested to start can absolutely join along on the ride here - just pm me. 

Anyone looking to start their next big venture/business, I look forward to meeting and brainstorming. I intend to form an A* Team with those at the NS.

Key interests: 
- I love animals and dogs. Big dog lovers, can meet Butter, my big labrador, on a weekend trip to Singapore. 
-  Reading, Nature, outdoors, fishing, camping, water-sports, outdoor survival, boxing, gym, biohacking, Trading.

An injury changed the trajectory of my career but still cheering on many friends who broke through to the next level, professional futbol.

My name is Sterlin. I am a crypto OG. I have been working professionally in the industry since 2015. 

I got into crypto after being arrested back in 2009 for possession of MDMA. This turned out to be a formative experience. It taught me that the State is a wholly corrupted and debauched, and things need immediate overhaul. 

It was this path that led me down an online rabbit hole. Sometime in 2013 I came into contact with people calling themselves ""cypherpunks."" Those circles introduced me to bitcoin, and we were off to the races. In this sense, I came into the space as an activist. I wanted --- and still want --- to leverage crypto as a means for personal liberation and societal change. 

I have had the opportunity to work directly with people like Roger Ver. I was with bitcoin.com as a news writer, opinion page editor, and communications lead. Then I worked in risk management for an OTC trading desk called Cryptospace. And now I am working in the Network State ecosystem with Logos as a communications professional and writer for a year already. 

I have spoken at dozens of cryptocurrency / tech  conferences, have worked with some of the top players in the space, and seen unimaginable things. I also wrote and published a book called ""Dignity & Decency: Rhapsodic Musings of a Modern Anarchist."" My wife and I have no children and are quasi-digitally nomadic.

687,Ethan,ethan.crypto,"Hey everyone I am Ethan! I am 24 years old born and raised in Houston Texas. I have been working in the crypto space as an Ethereum developer/ethical hacker for 3 years. I started off as a content creator for Dapp University, building full stack dapp tutorial videos for his YT Channel.

688,Emi,emideluxe,"Hi all! This is Emi, let's just say I've worn quite a few hats over the past 20 years from working as an architectural photographer to teaching English as a foreign language, building communities in tech startups and most recently designing furniture and getting deeper into cybersecurity. Learned about bitcoin back in 2016 when my jaw dropped on the floor while reading the whitepaper but managed to pick up the pieces in the meantime, no worries. I will look intact when you'll see me. Looking forward to this fantastic journey! Be kind, rewind. ✌️","['Cybersecurity', 'Community Building', 'Crypto', 'Bitcoin']"
690,Brandon,photonic,"Happy to be here, and look forward to connecting.

I’m Brandon, 29 years old, from Nova Scotia, Canada.

My primary areas of interest are decentralization, AI and storytelling. My hobbies/passions include creative writing, spending time on CT (Crypto Twitter), experimenting with new AI tools, and more recently Muay Thai. 

The core concept of Network States has been something I’ve imagined from a young age, and I believe it’s a paradigm shift that’s now inevitable. Countless micro nations where like minded people can find their tribe, come together and thrive. I plan to document my journey at the Network School and create a film, and build an AI x Network State related venture. 

Let’s learn and grow together, cheers.","['Decentralization', 'AI', 'AI Tools', 'Creative Writing', 'Crypto', 'Storytelling', 'Film', 'Network States', 'Muay Thai']"

696,Vincent,v_for_vincent,"Hi everyone! My name is Vincent. I was born in China 🇨🇳, went to school in New Zealand 🇳🇿 and Canada 🇨🇦, and worked in the US 🇺🇸 for the past decade or so, mostly at various big tech companies as a software engineer. I've been a digital nomad the past 3 years in search of the best place to live, and will soon be settling in Japan 🇯🇵 (I'd totally do Singapore if the cost of living weren't so high 🥲).

I got into crypto in 2020 at the end of DeFi summer, and have since gone down the rabbit hole. I'm a big believer in many of the ideologies brought about by the crypto ethos, and I'm super excited by the idea of building a Network State, seeing the decline of the western world in recent years. I'm also a health/fitness/longevity hobbyist, and have been following Bryan Johnson's Blueprint since inception. I'm currently experimenting with the carnivore diet, and can't wait to try out the Blueprint in its full glory!

At Network School, I'm hoping to meet and learn from you all. This is such a rare an incredible opportunity and I'm super glad to be a part of it!","['Software Development', 'Crypto', 'Digital Nomad', 'Health', 'Health and Wellness']"
697,John,johngiuffre,"Hey everybody! Great to meet you all 🙂

My name is John and I am a comedian by night and freelance creative director/consultant by day. I live in Toronto, Canada but am originally from Connecticut in the USA. I live here with my fiance (just got engaged last week right before being admitted to network school haha)

Some things we may have in common / quick 101 on my work

+ Big fan of Bryan Johnson's blueprint (writing from my incline walk on the  treadmill)
+ Big fan of block chain and crypto for making new solutions to the world's problems (I worked on 2 tech startups including Ideamarket.io which aimed to create block chain based sense making tools including the BoO - block chain of opinions)
+ Big fan of digital nomadism (spent a few years bouncing around the US and Canada before getting a spot in Toronto)
+ I love the creator economy and believe content is going to be as powerful as capital and code for building influence, and eventually network states
+ Big fan of alternative modes of educating ourselves and each other. I'm a creative director and cofounder of FourGame Dynamics , a company that aims to help us all think holistically ( 100 second 101 explainer - https://youtu.be/B2TquwuTBLw?si=38DGu4a6KO2N2ukv )
+ Big fan of American/Western nnovation and  freedom - I helped write policy and communications about integrating the US Government with BTC (among other things) for the Lars Mapstead Libertarian campaign this year (lars24.com/economy) 
+ Been doing standup comedy and writing since I was a wee lad, and recently finished my first sketch revue at Second City in Toronto

Hoping to come to network school in mid November for a week!! So pumped to meet you guys then!

My name is Elias Marshall, I have a small finance youtube channel with around 2k subscribers and have been buying BTC since 2016 when I was 13 years old.

699,Svetlana,lovethyneighbornotthyingroup,"Hi everyone 👋 My name is Svetlana, born in Belarus, grew up in NYC and very curious about being an expat in a few years after building a bit more financial stability. I love the amount of opportunity for me here in NYC but the lack of safety, amount of group-think and intolerance for different ideas makes me unsure if this is the best place for me  to stay. I love the idea of network states. I’ve lived a very unconventional “career.” I am a freelance photographer, personal assistant, and party person (planning, staffing, coordination, bartending!) I also am a community organizer. Right now, I’m committed to exploring all of my curiosities. Life is too short. 

I’m not super well versed in crypto but am particularly curious about web3/community daos. I’m extremely bullish on AI and am excited for all the good that is yet to come— devices for the blind and deaf, cancer treatment, and so much more. Before this summer, I’ve never built a line of code in my life. Using Claude, I’ve been able to build 5 websites and chatbots and tools and just having lots of fun! I am a creator and need to constantly be tinkering on little creative side projects like community building, writing, art, social media content etc. 

At NS, I hope to meet other creators and friendly people, have focus time to strategically plan and work on my businesses, get fit, explore Singapore and nearby areas on weekends perhaps and just learn new things! 

Looking forward to meeting everyone!!","['Community Builder', 'Community Organizer', 'Creator Economy', 'Freelancer', 'Photography', 'AI']"
700,Jim,jim_nomad,"Humbled to learn from so many inspiring folks from around the world in Network School! Wow!  And good to see <@837770078707384331>, <@816374649319063584>, <@238393956747051011> etc from earlier beta lecture group back in 2021! 

On introductions, I’m Jim, Chinese-American currently raising two kids in Manila, Philippines (in this volatile region here, on nearly weekly basis, there could erupt nationalistic and cold-war-like flashpoints for potential escalation into wider Indo-Pacific conflict in terms of worst case scenario. The Philippines is cursed to be in the “Bermuda Triange” between South China Sea Spratlys Islands, Island of Taiwan, and Island of Guam).

I'm here to learn from everyone for the sake of my kids and their generation. I hope my young sons eventually become future TNS Netizens and eventually thrive in new ecosystems that promise a more open, less fragmented, and less antagonistic future — in which one doesn't have to be restricted by nation-state defined systems as “other”, “foreigner”, or “threat to XYZ“ because one holds different passport. 

I’m disturbed at how potentially dangerous a junction we are in right now relative to macro history arcs, with the currently sparring Western-order establishment (e.g. G7) versus emerging non-Western (e.g. BRICS) forces. I am appreciative of the network state/network society movement’s potential to explore more peaceful, independent “Linux” paradigms that could, to borrow words of Balaji, engage enterprising Americans, tech progressive Indians, global Chinese, forward looking Europeans and Latin Americans, and aspiring builders from Africa, SE Asia and other Global South areas all together. Places like Singapore would also benefit from more peace and tech globalism amid all the drums of decoupling and war.

Many thanks to <@777003807279677500> for starting a peaceful global movement (with a school) that is important for future generations on Earth.

705,Andrew,jackdaw1392,"Hey, everybody. I'm Andrew. I'm an ethical hacker, cybersecurity consultant and crypto enthusiast. I stack sats and I run nodes for several projects. The last few years I've been a full-time digital nomad, traveling between Chile, Peru, El Salvador and Mexico. I'm anxious to begin the Asia part of my tour.

I'd like to help establish a blockchain security wing for the cybersecurity company that I work with the most. I don't know enough about blockchain security and I hope to learn it here from some of you others. (There may be employment opportunity for you here even). I'm also open to working with any startups on their overall cybersecurity practice.

It's also my dream to someday make a set of interconnected games on the blockchain, where the progress and outcomes of one game has ripple effects on the other games, where objects, characters and skills can be transferred back and forth, and ultimately where players can create a marketplace of mods and get paid directly by their fans for their work. I'm a member of Neo Tokyo DAO, but with all my competing priorities, the video games part of my life always falls to the bottom.

707,George,odysseus0z,"Hey everyone, George here. I discovered Balaji's 1729 community after leaving big tech out of boredom, and it's been life-changing. Since then, I've been deep in crypto, currently working at Flashbots, where we solve MEV problems and build Ethereum infrastructure like MEV-Boost. We're also exploring hardware-based solutions like TEE for credible and confidential computing (same tech used for Apple Intelligence). On the side, I invest in and advise startups and funds in the space.

My Network School goal is to step back and refocus on the big questions. I'm at a ""mid-life crisis"" point as a crypto builder, seeing how much of the space has drifted from the original crypto spirit. Some key concerns I have include:

1. Centralization Creep: Growing influence of institutional players (e.g., ETFs) potentially centralizing power and increasing vulnerability to attacks.
2. Speculative Casino Culture: Influx of opportunists and scammers across all levels, turning the industry into a speculative playground—where the yield/return comes from.
3. Self-Regulation Failure: Industry's struggle to self-regulate and prevent bad actors from hijacking the movement, exposing limitations of libertarian ideals.
4. Hype Over Substance: Prevalence of shallow, overhyped projects optimized for impressing retails and quick exits rather than creating real impact or sustainable business/protocol, fostering a culture of pseudo-profound but ultimately meaningless innovations.

Balaji's clear big-picture thinking was what I loved most about 1729. (I often joke he's our era's Hari Seldon, while I'm still the clueless encyclopedist – Foundation fans will get it.)

I'm here to:

1. Find my own answers to the big questions about crypto as an industry and movement
2. Get a clearer picture of our current world
3. Gain more clarity and conviction for my future path

My current focus is learning and I think the world is going to prefer trustless technologies in the next decade, so that is a key interest of mine, along with other things.
