My Background:
‚Äî Led investments across multiple crypto projects both professionally (through VC funds) and personally
‚Äî Served as a board member advising organizations including the BBC on their web3 strategy
‚Äî Deep expertise in both traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems, official LinkedIn instructor for Blockchain in the French Market.

We're building a platform that crowdsources the best DeFi strategies through our proprietary analytics engine and lists them as ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) on traditional stock exchanges. This creates an accessible on-ramp for TradFi to participate in DeFi yields.

We're backed by notable investors including Animoca and Tenity (the Swiss vc fund of UBS, and Franklin Templeton and other large Banks) and while our analytics and trading engines are live in beta, we have partnerships lined up to launch our first ETP in the next 6 month on the Swiss Stock Exchange.

I moved to silicon valley when it was cool, at Apple ATG initially, later some startups, then left before it became uncool, was a digital nomad in Thailand, living the dream, mountain villa, wife,  2 kids, car - then ended up taking 3 years off on a spiritual path, sat with teachers and Gurus, became determined to reach enlightenment, meditated, found the most direct teachings, ended up in Bali without the ex-wife but with the kids which was / is epic, they are the best üòâ 
One day, I became aware of reality - and that was enough for me and I got the message, back to work now! The next day, I was hired as CTO of an ICO play - it fell apart quickly, but I learned a lot. Then I worked on Seeds and Hypha DAO, a conscious currency and a DAO platform. 

I am very much interested in the idea of network state; it is very clear to me that society is collapsing, not fit for a new state of consciousness emerging on earth, and the vision was always to build the new earth instead of fighting the old. Been on this journey for 6 years now - it's going to happen. 

Burning man was my inspiration for what an utopian society can look like - everyone volunteers, everyone does what they like to do, and everything gets done synchronistically. A giving economy. 

But before we get there on a large scale and in the real world, blockchain is our bridge - to get out of the money slave system and create peace on earth. Any currency that's not corrupted basically would do - but blockchain is a technology that just so happens to fit the bill.

üë∑ Professionally: Consulting, infrastructure/transportation, agribusiness, and more recently in education.

üåè Network state/society community discussion participation: 1729, Plumia discussion groups, Network Society Camp, TNS Connect Writers, Network School v1, etc.

üë®‚Äçüçº Personally: Raising two young sons who I hope become Netizens.

üìñ Areas of interest, research, and hoping to learn:
* How the network could enable us to transcend nation state boundaries and identity stack. (The nation state through passports/national ID/SS # define our identity stack from birth to death‚Ä¶could that change?)

* How network societies could become multi-generational and develop more innovative educational paths. (I hope my sons and others in their generation continue the momentum to grow up and be educated as Netizens.)

* How network strength could help diaspora communities survive amid geopolitical tensions and fearmongering. (As Chinese-American I worry about Sinophobia & McCarthyism/yellow peril narratives like what happened in Indonesia in 1990‚Äôs; anti-Chinese diaspora sentiment on the rise in Philippines where I am based.)

Chinese-American, studied cognitive science at UC Berkeley. Explored tech in Silicon Valley (VR/AR, 3D printing, crypto, maker culture). Currently traveling Southeast Asia after two years in Mexico City.

My work spans education (built makerspaces for 10,000+ high schoolers in Peru/Colombia), health (co-founded IBDCoach), crypto (community strategy @ web3 venture studio and protocols), and now AI. 

For the last three years, I've focused entirely on AI‚Äîbuilding and deploying ideas quickly.

Currently building Speak To Earn to empower native speakers from low-resource communities, helping create AI that reflects humanity's linguistic diversity. Recently won two first place prizes at the Safe Agentathon (https://devfolio.co/projects/yapper-9cfd).

I think deeply about starting conditions for products, communities, and societal transformation. At scale, startup societies are an alignment problem‚Äîbringing the right people together around shared values.

My time living in Mexico for two years has shown me how communities form around values rather than geography. This journey led me to Network School, where I hope to find high agency, creative people to collaborate with.

I spend most of my time vibe coding with AI and focusing on my health and meditating. 

Core values: Freedom, Growth, Connection.

Interests: AI, crypto, vibe coding, frontier / startup societies, human-ai collaboration / intelligence augmentation, speaking new languages, future of user interfaces, history, philosophy. 

Currently studying with Math Academy to dive deeper into AI/ML. 

Hobbies: FOOD (ran a 900-person foodies group in CDMX), boxing, AI art, music.

I‚Äôll be joining Network School on April 1st and super excited to be here! 

I just graduated from the University of Sydney and had worked as an ESG Analyst in Sydney and as a Private Equity Analyst in Shenzhen. Now, I‚Äôm focused on launching my own Tibetan incense brand and connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.

I‚Äôm also deeply passionate about yoga and Vipassana meditation, which have been transformative to me. Vipassana is a technique that helps bring the unconscious mind to the surface. As Goenka said, there are three kinds of thoughts: one is like ripples on the water, fleeting and temporary; another like a line drawn on the sand, easily washed away by the waves. But the third is an imprint carved into stone, lasting through time. This third kind is what‚Äôs stored deep in the iceberg of our unconscious mind, secretly influencing our behaviors‚Äîwhat we often call fate. Practicing Vipassana has been the greatest gift of the past year, and I hope to share this experience with others.

Also! I‚Äôll be in Mt. Gambier for a Deep Week to get my Wave 2 certification, so I‚Äôll be in Sydney/Melbourne from March 12-24. Catch me for a coffee if you're around!  Can‚Äôt wait to meet y‚Äôall.","['ESG Analyst', 'Finance', 'Meditation', 'Yoga']"

Hey guys - I‚Äôm building¬†Relentless! We‚Äôre a fast-growing startup that‚Äôs revolutionizing the job search process with AI and Machine Learning‚Äîalready @ 7 figures in revenue profitably in just a few years & growing quickly.

We‚Äôre looking for a Chief of Staff for a high-impact, cross-functional role working across marketing, sales, product, and engineering. This isn‚Äôt just an operational role; it‚Äôs a launchpad to a COO position at a company that‚Äôs already changing lives‚Äîhelping job seekers land $50K+ salary bumps and even double their income.

Why this role is exciting:

üî• Work directly with a Columbia-educated, ex-McKinsey founder who has sourced deals for investors behind Netflix, Tinder, and AngelList

üìà Scale an already successful cold email system from 50K to 100K+ weekly emails

üí∞ Help optimize tens of thousands of job applications per month to increase conversion rates and revenue

üöÄ Fast-paced, high-growth environment with a clear path to COO

üí° Work with AI, automation, and cutting-edge growth strategies

Super open to having you work remotely, but there‚Äôs potential for relocation as the company scales. Compensation includes a significant commission-based component, ideal for someone hungry to grow and directly impact the company‚Äôs success & join me and my other business partners as we scale.

This doesn‚Äôt need experience, just RAW IQ, horsepower, and the desire to co-run a company that‚Äôs already crushing it.

‚Ä¢ For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same‚Äîthis is still ongoing and one of the main reasons I applied to NS.

‚Ä¢ Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto‚Äîsetting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.).

‚Ä¢ Learning a lot about AI‚Äîboth top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).

‚Ä¢ Beginner Muay Thai learner‚Äîwould love to take classes at NS. Anyone else interested in learning or teaching? Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, etc., are also on the table. Let‚Äôs connect!

  

**Network School**

I‚Äôll be arriving in April, and my first project will be setting up a microschool/homeschooling community to make it easier for families to stay at NS for extended periods. The model will follow the **2-hour model / Alpha School approach**, where kids learn autonomously with AI tutors at their own pace‚Äîwithout human tutors for the basic core curriculum.


Next, the microschool would expand to afternoon sessions led by human coaches/mentors/motivators. Their role would be to help kids discover their passions, cultivate curiosity, and become 10x versions of themselves through human collaboration and AI. The focus would be on life skills, soft skills, and preparing for the future. The ultimate goal: involve kids in **building the future of society**‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs their future, and they should help shape it as soon as possible.
 

I hope to bootstrap this as quickly as possible. If you‚Äôre interested‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre bringing kids, planning to stay long-term, or want to be involved‚Äîplease reach out!
  

I‚Äôll be at NS in April, then taking a short break before returning in June/July and staying until the end. My plan is to get the microschool up and running quickly so my family can join long-term next academic year‚Äîand to make it easier for other families to come. There‚Äôs no society without families and kids, so this will be my top priority.
  

I should probably put this intro on a website instead of dropping this wall of text here üòÖ

I am a techno-optimist and have been working in Deep learning domain for ~6 years. Mostly I like to work either as freelancer, consultant,  remote jobs or on my own products and research ideas.

One reason I am particularly excited about network school is because I believe this is how communities and even nations of future should work. Grouping people based on their shared values and interests makes so much more sense than grouping based on geographical location of birth. 

Also, I believe that it's not just opportunity but also our responsibility to have a specific vision for the world we want to see when technology makes EVERYTHING possible because pre-internet era institutions won't survive post-AGI era.  IMO, one right direction would be to create a world of abundance and compassion for all biological beings. So far, it was Natural selection that helped in gene improvement but it also led to so much cruelty and suffering because it is based on scarcity of resources and zero sum competition. In world of abundance, we can just program genes and improve them in specific directions we want. All the species should be augmented with artificial intelligence and inter-species communication should be made possible so that planet earth actually becomes a much more healthy and happy place to live. 

Some projects I am exploring currently -

I‚Äôm Elijah. 29, from Houston, Texas. (I actually do say howdy and y‚Äôall unironically)

I‚Äôve been a nerd ever since I received a breadboard for my 10th birthday. Been fixing hardware and cracking into my neighbors WEP ‚Äú*secured*‚Äù WiFi since I was 13 since we couldn't afford working computers or internet. I got a job in networking when I was 18, and have since graduated the University of Houston with a BS in Computer Information Systems. Somewhere in between there I learned about crypto (I will only answer the question ‚Äú*how*‚Äù over a Moutai) and I‚Äôve been hooked for nearly the last 10 years.

In my day-job, I work at a global accounting firm where I teach professionals why they need to care about crypto and how it works. I also am in the process of scaling our blockchain community. I love what I do, but I‚Äôll be taking a month off of that to come see what the Network School is all about in July.

After (*during*) work I also work on whatever side-projects I think would be fun, scalable, and make me a millionaire before 30 (I‚Äôve got 9 months left). My favorite one right now is a Twitter page that automatically enhances and highlights AI art that I handpick, though it hasn't made me any money (yet). When I‚Äôm not doing that, I love to workout (actually hate it), walk in the sun, be at the beach, play basketball (big one), and win Marvel Rivals games (plat now, but just getting started).

I started in journalism at Prisa Media (Spain), covering major global events and expanding media across Europe, Spain and Latin America. But in 2012, I became fascinated by the idea that technology, specifically blockchain, could rebuild the media industry, making it more transparent, independent, and resilient. That curiosity led me to ConsenSys, where I was a founding member of Civil, one of the first attempts to decentralize journalism. Later, as Director of Communications and Partnerships at the Web3 Foundation in Switzerland, I helped to launchPolkadot. 

Now, as CMO of Scytale Digital VC and an advisor to Project Liberty (Frequency blockchain), I‚Äôm focused on building bridges between technology, media, and business. Project Liberty recently made a bid to acquire TikTok in the US with the goal of decentralizing it. We shall see how that unfolds, but the ambition is clear: put control back into the hands of users.

233,Gabi,raskogabi,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm Gabi, and I‚Äôll be arriving with my husband and our sons on April 1st (my husband, <@501503366350766116> , has already introduced himself above).  ü•≥ 

I was born in Budapest, Hungaryüá≠üá∫ , but I also lived in Mexico üá≤üáΩ  and Brazil üáßüá∑ as a child. For the past three years, we‚Äôve been living in Bali. üå¥ 

Originally, I trained as a lawyer and worked in television before having kids, mainly in international program acquisitions. Then, in 2013, my husband founded MrCoin, Hungary‚Äôs first Bitcoin exchange, and I was involved in that journey as well. <:bitcoin:1282286965794017280> It was incredibly exciting to introduce the then-unknown concept of Bitcoin to Hungary and to help build and educate the community around it. We organized Bitcoin film festivals, gave talks, and produced the Bitcoin segment for Hungary‚Äôs most well-known financial radio show weekly for many years. One of the highlights of this journey was unveiling the world‚Äôs first Satoshi statue in Budapest, which has since become a global symbol of Satoshi. We‚Äôre very proud of that! Fun fact: the statue was originally planned to have a hat, I was the one who convinced the team that the statue absolutely had to have a hood. üôÉ .  

I‚Äôm not a tech person by nature ‚Äî I‚Äôm more interested in how technology and society influence each other. This applies to both cryptocurrencies and AI. I‚Äôm not so much focused on what happens at the code level, but rather how these innovations can be used for the benefit of humanity, maximizing their positive impact while minimizing potential risks. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚òÆÔ∏è ü´Ç 

I have a deep passion for working with children. üíó üö∏ As a UNICEF volunteer for years, I helped run interactive workshops on children's rights and the realities of kids living in different parts of the world. I‚Äôm a Third Culture Kid (TCK), and my sons are as well, so I have extensive experience‚Äîboth as a former TCK myself and now as a parent‚Äîon what it means to grow up across multiple countries. I understand the advantages and challenges of this lifestyle and how to enhance the positives while mitigating the difficulties. I even wrote a children's book on this topic, which won the ""Children‚Äôs Book of the Year"" award in Hungary in 2024. Additionally, I run educational Facebook groups in Hungary on topics like TCK kids, as well as women and AI. I am the co-founder of an indie book publishing company in Hungary called Zazie Books.

Beyond this, I have a background in journalism, political analysis, mediation, and coaching. I‚Äôm currently furthering my education to specialize in coaching children as well. üë©‚Äçüéì 

My father was a member of Hungary‚Äôs first freely elected government after the fall of the communist regime, which gave me a deep insight from a young age into how a traditional nation-state operates. This, along with my legal background, makes it fascinating for me to rethink the role and function of the state from the ground up. This is one reason why I find NS so exciting. My husband and I also share a goal of creating a space, school, and workshops for the children of NS residents ‚Äî ensuring they can grow and evolve alongside the adults. After all, while we‚Äôre trying to figure out what the future will look like, they are the ones who will live in it the longest, so I believe it's essential to involve them in shaping it. üöÄ 

I have no harmful addictions‚Äîunless you count books, movies, and contemporary art and architecture... üòä

I‚Äôm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and would love to chat and exchange ideas on any of these topics.

Made a friend ""Awais"" üá≥üá¥ today and we went to Singapore but ended up in a historical Supreme Court holding cell!

A couple weeks ago I bet a bunch of money on Polymarket that Trump is gonna win, won 10k$ but, of course, got addicted immediately. So then I bet a bunch of more money that there'll be a ceasefire in the Ukraine war before Trump's inauguration; so I'm a bit tense and constantly checking my phone for news related to that event.

I‚Äôm Chinese-American from Midwest but mostly exited the US since around 10 years ago, first moving to Brasil and then now in Southeast Asia in the Philippines. Got two young sons who I hope to be netizens of network societies in the future. For much of my life, I‚Äôve tried to as a neutral avoid collateral damage from the escalating US-China conflict, but the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù somehow always comes back ‚Äî most recently in the form of nearly monthly South China Sea scares near the Philippines (which could rock the entire Indo-Pacific region) and fears of return of McCarthyism by US/US ‚Äúvassals‚Äù (not so much about the ‚Äúanti-Communist‚Äù part but concerns rooted in the potentially unfair and unethical targeting of particular minority disapora groups). 

I am thankful for the frameworks that Balaji has envisioned - for it gives me hope that milions of neutrals, nomads, migrants, third-culture-kids, etc can try to find peaceful independent alternate paths for themselves and their families ‚Äî hopefully peacefully independent from clutches of legacy nation states that have power to commit violence, confiscation, cancellation, suspicion, persecution, and shaming of those accused of being not ‚Äúnationalistic/patriotic‚Äù enough or accused of not loving ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù enough. 

Hoping for a future in which my kids and others in their generation would no longer be judged or limited by the color of their passport/national id/social security card. (Nowadays, to be born, to go to school, to get employed, to travel globally, to get married, to have kids, to retire, and even to die and pass on inheritance ‚Äî one would need recognition from a nation state!). Nothing against nation states, respecting them, just seeking peaceful alternatives.

I'm Shar from Vancouver. My entrepreneurial background spans multiple industries including agrichemicals, cannabis, real estate, entertainment, and some tech (an area I'm hoping to expand on). I've worked on pre-IPO capital raises, advised startup founders, and served on a co-op board (lots of parallels with web3). I thrive in project-based sprints, working with small, motivated teams to solve exciting problems. 

I'm coming off a six-year sprint building and exiting a cannabis company. The past year has been exploratory, focusing on new ways of work and refining not just what I want to work on, but how.
Themes of particular interest: 
-Digital products and apps
-Audience-first building
-AI-driven low-cost development
-Projects beyond excessive regulatory scrutiny -[as Balaji discusses regarding the administrative state](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWMcRRkuak>)

These align with my belief that smaller teams can do high-leverage work (@naval speaks about this a lot -[see page 60 of the Almanack of Naval Ravikant](<https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf>). Long-term, I aim to build skills and a network for a venture studio-type model, creating tasteful projects for people with audiences (yes, this could be a DAO, my crypto friends).

NS couldn't have come at a better time. Inspired by [Levelsio's 12 projects in 12 months](<https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>), my goal is to collaborate on ""indie hacker"" type projects. Instead of solo development, multiple people with domain expertise building, testing, and launching projects quickly. See what fails or gains traction, focusing on building for or with an audience. I have a few projects I've been building with my own network but would be cool to build with some likeminded NS admits -would be extra cool to look at projects we could build for the NS community! If this interests you, feel free to DM me or start a thread. Looking forward to connecting!

Joining the Network School feels like it's the ""connecting the dots"" moment in my life!

I‚Äôm 22 years old and have been homeschooled since I was 10. In 2019, I founded China‚Äôs only homeschooler community. The desire to see the community achieve prosperity through emergence led me to explore organizational development, which is how I recognize DAO. Once my anarchist spirit met crypto, there was no turning back.

Over the past five years, I‚Äôve been involved in over 100 projects without attending college. About 30% didn‚Äôt fail, and 3% were a big success. Last year, as a digital nomad at Zuzalu, I began to wonder why college couldn‚Äôt be nomadic, prove yourself with portfolio instead of diploma?

I tried to bring this idea to life with hundreds of co-creators and got $206,000 in pledged donations, but everything was shut down by the Political Security Bureau in China. I nearly ended up in jail. They feared the education for freedom and the infiltration through crypto investment.

After that, I realized it was time to leave China and build on a global scale. So when I saw the Network School, I know it's where I should come.","['Alternative Education', 'DAO', 'Decentralized Governance', 'Digital Nomad', 'Crypto', 'Community Building', 'Anarchism']"

- Thankful to have learnt about BTC also while in college, with a bright orange bitcoin ATM in our college lobby

- I‚Äôve had several moments in my life when financial constraints prevented me from pursuing opportunities beyond Singapore. Witnessing how stronger financial resources opened doors for my peers to globally renowned opportunities, which in turn led to even more, was a major reality check for me.

- This experience fueled my 'chip on my shoulder' to create and pursue global opportunities, even while being homebound

- It also cemented my strong belief in crypto as the decentralized and open financial system of our generation, allowing me to work alongside global talent, regardless of where we‚Äôre based.

I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of the Network School because the idea of the Network State represents a pivotal leap in the evolution of democracy. Moreover, it‚Äôs not just where the world is headed; it's a blueprint for accelerating our most ambitious endeavors.

The Network State seems like our best hope at creating a bedrock for true progress, reshaping possibilities not to not just only sovereignty, but also the human superpower of cooperation, and unencumbered innovation across diverse spheres (e.g., catalyzing breakthroughs like the gene therapies emerging in Pr√≥spera, Honduras).

I decided to join the network school because I was at a point in my life where I figured I needed more personal experiences to know myself & where I want to go in the future better, and be able to learn from very interesting people from all over the world.

I also love playing Frisbee (will bring one if anyone wants to chill on the beach durring the sunset), swimming, Music, and experimenting with new technologies

469,Lane,lanewatchous,"Hello, everyone! My name is Lane. I was born and raised in the oil fields of the Midwestern United States before moving to sunny California at the age of 18 to study computer science. Growing up in a family business instilled in me a great appreciation for value creation, individual sovereignty, personal responsibility, and rugged entrepreneurship from a young age. I‚Äôm interested in absolutely everything but my favorite project right now is a suite of software that uses ML to evaluate seismic data and locate new oil reserves with ~90+% accuracy.

I‚Äôve traveled the world for the past few years and couldn‚Äôt agree more with Balaji‚Äôs vision for the Network State. We need to move beyond centralized states that maintain power through fiat, war-mongering, and sowing division. I envision a future comprised of sovereign individuals who maintain peace and trust through smart contracts and blockchain and increasingly democratize economic opportunity through innovation ‚Äúin the world of bits and atoms‚Äù as Thiel would say.

Balaji‚Äôs courage and foresight in organizing something of this magnitude is simply incredible. I will be in Forest City for all three months and intend to be a ‚Äúmore-than-full-timer,‚Äù investor, founding member, and just generally involved as much as possible.

474,Milan,senatus.,"Hi all! I'm Milan from the Netherlands, also known as Mira Hurley on Twitter (it's a long story..)

My background is mostly finance and economics, having founded my own companies in the sector, worked for the Dutch central bank where I learnt just how slow-moving institutions can be, and having first encountered Bitcoin in 2012. Nowadays I'm a self-taught programmer, together with my co-founder we built NanoGPT which uses crypto to allow anyone, anywhere to access the best LLMs and image generation tools.

The Network School is genuinely the perfect combination of everything that I'm excited about:- crypto & AI are my main interests and fill my professional life nowadays, Bryan Johnson is the inspiration for our health protocol, Balaji's (and Patri Friedman's!) vision of the future of states is the kind of future I want to see (and help build) and since my girlfriend also got accepted we even get to do this together. On a sidenote we're broadly being declared crazy by friends and family for ""joining this cult"" since this is starting just after we got back from a 6-month trip through South America, but I'm super excited about it.

I'm hoping we can make it to the Network State Conference in time. The previous one in Amsterdam was great so if anyone is doubting I can really recommend it. But if we don't make it to that, I'm looking forward to meeting you all on the first day of the program!","['Crypto', 'AI', 'Economics', 'Software Development']"

Born in the Philippines, raised in Thailand, and currently living in Sydney Australia

My personal experiences with the healthcare system made me obsessed with fixing it and I‚Äôve been on this mission now for the last 10 years. It really is the only reason I went back to Uni. So naturally I was delighted to discover <@777003807279677500>  work and learn his similar views on the FDA etc.

üéì  In college, I studied Computer Science & Social Entrepreneurship. The highlight of my college experience was **building entrepreneurial communities** ‚Äî I ran pitch competitions, hackathons, startup career fairs & art-and-music festivals. I also became **obsessed with AI** and, after graduating, I managed the first AI Index report at Stanford (https://aiindex.stanford.edu/).

üöÄ  For the last 6 years, I‚Äôve been **building digital products** with my friends. We participated in YC and have shipped 20+ products: ‚Äúdiscord for work‚Äù (back in 2018!), a sleep coaching service, a capture tool (https://capture.so/), a wine tracker, and many more!

**üéØ  My intentions for Network School are to:**
1. Be an engaged participant and active **community builder**, fostering an ideal environment for creating and sustaining global startups and communities.
2. Develop my perspective on the most promising opportunities to **leverage blockchain as a social technology**.
3. Be in the best physical, mental, and spiritual shape of my life. **Shoutout Blueprint**! Also excited to be around so many experienced meditators, I was not expecting that.
4. **Develop new skills.** I‚Äôve been learning-on-the-job for the past 8 years ‚Äî I‚Äôm excited for a slightly more structured approach to ‚Äúcontinuous education‚Äù.

**1. Personal Productivity Systems & Utilities.** I‚Äôm interested in structures that help people design-and-operate their life. From the lowest level todo lists to the highest level aspirations and vision boards. I‚Äôm still sitting in the question of how AI advancements can transform how we design our lives and get things done.
**2. Blueprint.** Making any aspects of the Blueprint protocol more accessible to consumers.
**3. Burning Man.** I‚Äôm coming fresh out of Burning Man and have some ideas. Is it possible to create a Blueprint-friendly Burning Man experience? Could blockchain-enabled devices / crypto-secured hardware be used to collect community feedback in a way that‚Äôs transparent and community-owned?
**4. What are you building!?** Nothing gets me more excited than other people‚Äôs passion to bring something into the world.

Broadly, I‚Äôm a pretty curious person. But to highlight some specific hobbies & interests: surfing, yoga, weight lifting, guitar, local-first software, tools for thought, consciousness, and community building.

I'm incredibly excited to be attending the network school with my partner.

**EU/accelerationism podcast**
Living in Spain is conflicting for me. It's challenging being a pro-capitalist, small-government kind of guy in this environment. However, I've channeled this challenge into action:

1. I've established a substantial chapter of the EU/ACC movement through strong local business communities.
2. I started a podcast where we stream on X/twitter Spaces, amplifying voices from a network of local live players. We've already reached over 600 attendees in our first stream.

I tend to sway pessimistic about Europe's current trajectory, but I‚Äôm determined to spark honest conversations about it and empower live players who can actually make a change.

I was born in the far north of Sweden, by the Arctic Circle. Some say I‚Äôm half Viking half S√°mi.

I was never motivated by authority so I always found school quite boring. I still went to university studying computer science and business for a dual degree. It mostly felt like a waste though and I spent most time learning following my own curiosity.

Since then I started a digital agency building POC for startups, developed a titanium-based DJ headphone used by top DJs like Diplo and Skrillex, co-founded a record label, built a cabin village in the mountains and co-founded a technology company developing AI models for automating valuation of real estate assets and opening up single-family homes at scale as a new asset class for institutional investors. 

Since my days in school I've been thinking about how demotivating the education system is. Academia is killing creativity and the joy of learning with its assembly line methods. I want to encourage students to dive straight into building at the edges of progress, without waiting for an academic diploma as a stamp of approval at the cost of your soul. I‚Äôm exploring a medium combining crypto, digital¬†art, animated video and gaming, infused with our deepest knowledge. This is where my focus is now and Network States seems like the perfect place to apply it.   

I like to read widely, produce (mostly electronic) music, design houses, take long walks and think about how the world works.

My goal at NS is to meet like-minded people who want to replace dysfunctional institutions and build better environments for optimism to flourish.

I agree with Balaji in so many ways especially when it comes to future of the humanity, but it might take so many years or even generations for things to start moving (I guess that‚Äôs why we are learning to live longer or simply don‚Äôt die in this school)

- Previously a journalist based in Washington D.C. reporting on world politics
- Switched to producing/directing stand-up comedy shows in China. Show biz in China is weirdly fun!
- Now a full-time writer, also run a travel agency focusing on tours in South East Asia 

What I can provide to NS (just did a little brainstorming)
- I make Chinese food and hot pot. If food is too healthy in NS, I‚Äôll try to cook and share food. Not sure if we‚Äôll have access to a decent kitchen, but we are close to a modern civilization (Singapore), so I‚Äôm sure we can figure something out
- I take people to Bali all the time. I‚Äôm like half a local, so if you need tips/recommendations, hey (waving hands)

539,Bjoern,recursion6241,"Hello everyone! I'm Bjoern from Germany, and really look forward to Network School. I always was interested in libertarian principles and looking for a truly meritocratic, free community. Back in 2015, I was one of the early visitors to Liberland, what should have been a new, libertarian micronation, but did not work out.

I first bought one Bitcoin in 2013 for ‚Ç¨100 in cash, back then I was looking for a privacy-focused way to pay online. Back then it was just one option on a long list next to paysafecard, VCCs, and prepaid cards, but crypto quickly became something I really care about for freedom and state-resistance.

Today, I run Lendorse, a startup that helps finance talented but underprivileged students from developing and emerging countries to study STEM MSc programs in Europe. There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, because I‚Äôve become increasingly skeptical about Europe's future.

I‚Äôm very interested in longevity. I see death as the final enemy and find it crazy how indifferent society is to it. I‚Äôve started my own ""Bryan light"" longevity protocol, with regular blood tests and various supplements, but I still struggle with sleep discipline and maintaining a good diet and hope for the peer pressure of the program.

Professionally, I studied economics and business at LSE and St. Gallen. After a couple of years at McKinsey, I left the corporate world and have been in the startup ecosystem ever since (TradFi & Logistics).

I probably arrive a few days late to network school (still sorting out my logistics), but I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting all of you soon!","['Cryptocurrency', 'Crypto Enthusiast', 'Libertarian', 'Startup Founder', 'Economics', 'Education']"

I'm a software developer building a decentralized code collaboration platform for open source development with my longtime friend and co-founder, Parth (he is also part of the program). I've always been fascinated by programming and its power to bring ideas to life. It's much more accessible compared to other careers where specialized instruments or capital are required for research. In comparison, we only need a laptop and an internet connection to conduct experiments; our ideas are the only limitation.

I started working with Parth in 2019. I had just left my 3-year stint at a tech startup and was taking a break to learn about machine learning, blockchain, and other emerging technologies. I still vividly remember the first time I sat down with Parth as he explained the concept behind cryptocurrencies and their practical applications, convincing me to work with him. More than the financial and speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, I was excited about the power to create micro-economies and incentives that could easily mobilize people across the world to work towards common goals. After that, we never looked back, and I've learned a lot both professionally and personally. In recent years, I've also been practicing meditation and improving my lifestyle for better health and slower aging. We have also been remotely working from Dubai, Bangkok and Banglore.

In 2013, I quit my corporate job as a Mechanical Engineer with $500 in my pocket to travel the world and ended up in Toronto. That‚Äôs when I first heard about Bitcoin, and since then I got hooked and slid right into the rabbit hole. 

Thanks to my degree, which is useless overseas, gave me the chance to explore and experiment with countless opportunities life has to offer, from waiting tables, bartending, real estate investing, and photography, to content creation and running my own restaurant, which got featured in multiple local Canadian media and became one of the top takeout spots in Toronto during the pandemic.‚Ä®

From the age of 10, I immersed myself in books daily.

At 14, I formed a group of friends around skateboarding. Together, we financed and constructed a skatepark in our village. This early taste of community building and bringing an idea to life fueled my ambitions.

At 19, I created a YouTube channel called 'People Of'. It quickly gained traction in the music scene, generating millions of views every month. It allowed me to earn my first internet money, empowering me to drop out of law school in Bordeaux and relocate to Paris.

At 21, I began exploring Augmented Reality, creating AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat. My Instagram filters rapidly made half a billion views. Facebook (now Meta) invited me to their London HQ. There, I connected with fellow creators and the Facebook team behind the Spark AR software, further expanding my horizons.

Currently, I'm passionate about 3D filmmaking in real-time, a cutting-edge technique using the power of Unreal Engine 5. This technology allows for near-instantaneous 3D rendering (unlike traditional 3D softwares that demands huge rendering time or access to costly render farms).

The last time this series of happy/surreal coincidences happened was when I truly understood AI and read the Bitcoin Whitepaper - all in the same week!

**About me**: 
I‚Äôm Electrik Dreams (https://x.com/electrik_dreams) - a futurist in awe of everything that's about to unravel in Emerging Technologies and passionately documenting it all.

IRL, I go by the name of Shabbir Haider. I'm the founder of Futurelab Studios (https://futurelabstudios.com/) - where I follow a community-centric, quest-based approach to make AI accessible to all - prioritizing low-income youth and social impact organizations. _My goal is to ensure an even distribution of the future and enable abundance for all._

I love reading (1. scifi 2. everything under the sun, in that order) and can often be found setting up book clubs.

I love meditating, have been to Vipassana twice and am honestly taken aback at the high frequency its being mentioned here. (surreal, indeed)

Most of all though - I love dreaming: 

- About a kind and abundant world, free from diseases, suffering and limitations.
- A world where we get to call the entire Universe, and not just this one lone planet, our Home. 

I believe we all have the unique privilege to get to build this dream into a concrete reality - in our own lifetime.

_P.S. I'm in Delhi, India - those of you planning to fly from here to attend the NS Conference on 22nd (gotta see Naval!) - let's plan together!_

I cannot believe this is happening. Balaji is my online guru and one of my heroes in crypto. The moment I saw this opportunity on twitter, I just jumped on it.

My name is Ramakanth. I am from India but living in Dubai for the last 3 years. Did my Bachelors in IT from India and then my MBA from Canada. Worked in Canada for 9 years but always wanted to get out of a 9 to 5 job and gain my financial freedom. Tried quite a few things such as mobile app development, e-book writing, stock trading, sports betting etc. but nothing worked out. Then I found crypto in Crypto in 2016 and from then on never looked back. Thanks to the bull run in 2021, I could save some money (enough to quit my regular job) and leave Canada. Have been in Dubai since 2021 and waiting for the next bull market to liquidate enough of my portfolio to gain financial freedom and move back to India permanently.

Lucky enough to be an early investor in projects such as Graph, Solana, Helium, Livepeer, Stacks etc. Full time crypto investor right now. Loving this independence and cannot think of working a 9 to 5 ever again.

Reading, Playing Cricket and Badminton, watching movies have been my hobbies lately. Trying out Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol for the last 2 months now. Seeing some good results and it would be interesting to meet Bryan directly and learn from him.

My name is Parth (30 years old), I am from India originally. I started my journey by dropping out of college and searching my path. I love technology and did freelancing for a long time before entering crypto. I ran a service company for a while before building a decentralized Github. 
As AI is changing everything, I  am working on another challenging idea that builds on top of it.

I love dogs and had a German shepherd for 10 years (passed away last year). He was something that grounded me in India so after that, I moved to wherever opportunities took me. I stay between India, Thailand and Dubai now.

I love that so many people here are into meditation, it‚Äôs amazing. Meditation changed my life. I started from the Vipassana retreat in Koh Phangan, thailand where I got my first experience which I couldn‚Äôt give words to and got hooked immediately. Post that I spent 8 months meditating in a retreat in India while working remotely. This restructured my understanding of spirituality and awareness.
I have also dabbed with longevity (food, medicines and fasting)  and seen dramatic changes that the body and mind have when done strictly.

Network School is an amazing opportunity and I intend to make the most of it. So anyone here needs some guidance/help in technology, development, crypto, or AI, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. Meanwhile, I definitely need help with marketing myself and what I build (I feel I am not so great at it) and also working out( I have never been a regular gym goer)
I understand that we all are here because we are all risk-takers who are not afraid to try something new. I feel that this experience will be transformative for each one of us.  I am excited to be around such a talented bunch of people and would love to talk and network with everyone here and learn from their journey.

I‚Äôm all about using cutting-edge onchain apps & infrastructure, understanding DeFi on a deep level, and educating others.

Since 2021 (just after defi summer), I‚Äôve been very active onchain. The onchain economy was growing, so I left my big4 IT Risk job and joined a venture capital syndicate investing in early stage DeFi projects. 

I built relationships with many of our LPs & became their go-to for everything onchain.

When the venture syndicate wound down, I doubled down on DeFi and built a company selling research. We covered projects like Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Aave, Maker, GMX, Jupiter, Curve, and more. 

Recently, I‚Äôve stepped back from that company, and my gf and I have been digital-nomad style traveling in SE Asia. 

Skills I‚Äôm leveling up at NS (**learn**):
1. **Onchain data analysis**.  Extracting insights from onchain data. 
2. **Financial analysis**. Building financial models for digital assets. 
3. **Programming**. Building onchain apps, ensuring security, and plugging onchain data into financial models.  
4. **Systems Design**. Building sustainable, secure, and scalable onchain apps that minimize/eliminate governance risk.
5. **Content creation**. Providing value beyond my existing client base, promoting NS builders and community members to the broader world, and helping educate others at scale to reduce onchain fraud, theft, and malinvestment. 

My favorite **burn** activities are weightlifting and Muay Thai.

I'm in my late 20s, I view myself as very libertarian / cypherpunk and vibing with that type of people is what got me in crypto a while ago.

I've been playing with an idea similar to The Network State based on the idea of creating and decentralizing open-source blueprints for factories (ideally employee owned) that would manufacture (as autonomously as possible) products that would themselves automate (as much as possible) the handling of people's needs. The idea being to give people on the ground the tools to come together and build the infrastructure to take care of themselves. 

Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the foundational level covers Food, Water, & Shelter. Then beyond that level: Health, Education, and Security. So for example the solution set for ""shelter"" could look like a blueprint for a factory that cranks out unfolding shipping container houses. 

My hobbies/interests include music (guitar, piano), travel (spent two years in Asia), amateur ancient history, survival skills, philosophy, spirituality, amateur biology, etc.

First business at 16. Failed 5 times before my first success in the Web3 Space as a project founder.

I love creating content, and I will create a ""Network State Journey"" series documenting our daily lives, activities and experiences. **Fellow content creators** or those interested to start can absolutely join along on the ride here - just pm me.

671,Faith,feides,"Hi Everyone,

A quick introduction: I‚Äôm Faith, a UI/UX Designer, gamer, and entrepreneur. 

* Drop out when I was 14 years old
* Headhunted by Alibaba as A Pass Talent in China without any formal certificate. 
* Build my own smart retail company in Shanghai and was feature in vogue. 

My design methodology is influenced by my passion for gaming. I grew up with J-Pop, RPGs, and animation. In the gaming world, I used to create guilds and fight my way to be the top guild on the game server, all while providing a nurturing environment for my guild members.

I have launched my own Web3 platform since 2023, with operations in Tokyo and Singapore. Our vision is to recreate the ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù concept of making the real world a game through DAO, AI, and gamification tools.

My goal here is to use these 3 months to train at a physical and mental level, focus more on product development, and find new party who share the same passion to explore and build the world together.

P.S. I practice mediation, Previously attended Vipassana 10-day meditation camp in Myanmar and Kyoto. So, aside from gaming, if you are also into meditation or interested in it, feel free to connect!","['UI/UX Design', 'Gaming', 'Entrepreneur', 'DAO', 'AI', 'Gamification', 'Meditation']"
672,Luis,tokenzentechcapital,"Hi Everyone! My name is Luis, I‚Äôm a first generation Portuguese American, born and raised in the inner city of Newark.

Chapter 1 of my life was all about ‚öΩÔ∏è played for the best academies in the country, spent time with the Real Madrid and Chelsea academy programs and played internationally including representing the US in 2010 (scored a hat-trick vs Hungary). An injury changed the trajectory of my career but still cheering on many friends who broke through to the next level, professional futbol.

Chapter 2 was the pivot. Worked tirelessly throughout university, was essentially a full time student along while working 40 hours a week. Worked at every level within the construction industry. Beginning as a systems designer, to project estimator, marketing manager, industrial lead, director of business development and then eventually assumed the VP position.

Chapter 3 is the present day. Voluntarily stepped away from the construction industry to go full time in crypto + revolutionary technologies. With gods grace, blessing, daily commitment and much sacrifice I was able to generate enough fortune to launch my own thematic family office venture fund - TokenZen Tech Capital.

Now 27 years young, I am hungrier and more passionate than ever before. Looking to network with absolutely everyone, share ideas, contribute as much as I can and grow as a human being.

679,Sterlin,lujansterlin,"Hello fellow network state experimenters! 

My name is Sterlin. I am a crypto OG. I have been working professionally in the industry since 2015. 

I got into crypto after being arrested back in 2009 for possession of MDMA. This turned out to be a formative experience. It taught me that the State is a wholly corrupted and debauched, and things need immediate overhaul. 

It was this path that led me down an online rabbit hole. Sometime in 2013 I came into contact with people calling themselves ""cypherpunks."" Those circles introduced me to bitcoin, and we were off to the races. In this sense, I came into the space as an activist. I wanted --- and still want --- to leverage crypto as a means for personal liberation and societal change. 

I have had the opportunity to work directly with people like Roger Ver. I was with bitcoin.com as a news writer, opinion page editor, and communications lead. Then I worked in risk management for an OTC trading desk called Cryptospace. And now I am working in the Network State ecosystem with Logos as a communications professional and writer for a year already. 

I have spoken at dozens of cryptocurrency / tech  conferences, have worked with some of the top players in the space, and seen unimaginable things. I also wrote and published a book called ""Dignity & Decency: Rhapsodic Musings of a Modern Anarchist."" My wife and I have no children and are quasi-digitally nomadic. 

I am here because I believe the network state is the path to realizing the vision of a more liberated humanity. I cannot wait to meet you all, continue our shared education, and help enlighten the denizens of this planet for the sake of our future.

+ Big fan of alternative modes of educating ourselves and each other. I'm a creative director and cofounder of FourGame Dynamics , a company that aims to help us all think holistically ( 100 second 101 explainer - https://youtu.be/B2TquwuTBLw?si=38DGu4a6KO2N2ukv )

707,George,odysseus0z,"Hey everyone, George here. I discovered Balaji's 1729 community after leaving big tech out of boredom, and it's been life-changing. Since then, I've been deep in crypto, currently working at Flashbots, where we solve MEV problems and build Ethereum infrastructure like MEV-Boost. We're also exploring hardware-based solutions like TEE for credible and confidential computing (same tech used for Apple Intelligence). On the side, I invest in and advise startups and funds in the space.

My Network School goal is to step back and refocus on the big questions. I'm at a ""mid-life crisis"" point as a crypto builder, seeing how much of the space has drifted from the original crypto spirit. Some key concerns I have include:

1. Centralization Creep: Growing influence of institutional players (e.g., ETFs) potentially centralizing power and increasing vulnerability to attacks.
2. Speculative Casino Culture: Influx of opportunists and scammers across all levels, turning the industry into a speculative playground‚Äîwhere the yield/return comes from.
3. Self-Regulation Failure: Industry's struggle to self-regulate and prevent bad actors from hijacking the movement, exposing limitations of libertarian ideals.
4. Hype Over Substance: Prevalence of shallow, overhyped projects optimized for impressing retails and quick exits rather than creating real impact or sustainable business/protocol, fostering a culture of pseudo-profound but ultimately meaningless innovations.

Balaji's clear big-picture thinking was what I loved most about 1729. (I often joke he's our era's Hari Seldon, while I'm still the clueless encyclopedist ‚Äì Foundation fans will get it.)

I'm here to:

1. Find my own answers to the big questions about crypto as an industry and movement
2. Get a clearer picture of our current world
3. Gain more clarity and conviction for my future path

Back in China I worked as a journalist for many years and now I‚Äôm leading a public goods donation fund named GCC and also providing marketing consulting services for a ZK project.  In between I worked in Binance as devrel marketing for less than a year.

I would define myself as a content creator. In my free time I write my own blog, write music, etc. I‚Äôm planning to write a book next year to deep dive into the ethics and political views in crypto space and I hope I can get more ideas during my stay in Network school. 

I love traveling and just finished a long trip in Latin America. I‚Äôve been to Malaysia 5 years ago but it was a short trip. Hope to explore more this time!","['Journalism', 'Content Creator', 'Crypto', 'Traveling', 'Public Goods']"
