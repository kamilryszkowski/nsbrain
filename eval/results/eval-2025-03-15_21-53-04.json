      "question": "What's the difference between a Startup Society and a Network State?",
      "answer": "A startup society is an early-stage, alternative society formed to address a specific societal problem in an opt-in way. It aims to demonstrate a better way of doing things by recruiting people online to voluntarily participate. A network state can emerge from a startup society, but it represents a more mature and potentially larger-scale version of the concept.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Startup Society:** Think of this as being similar to a \"startup\" company. It's in the early stages of its development.\n*   **Network State:** This is a more developed form, potentially with a digital network union, a physical network archipelago, or formal legal recognition.\n\nThe relationship between \"startup society\" and \"parallel society\" is similar to that of \"startup\" and \"tech company.\" The former is early stage, while the latter can be of any stage. A \"parallel society\" is an umbrella term that can denote a wholly digital network union, a partially physical network archipelago, or a diplomatically recognized network state.\n\nSources:\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment>\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment>\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment>\n",
