      "question": "What's the difference between a Startup Society and a Network State?",
      "answer": "A startup society is an early-stage, alternative society that aims to address a specific societal problem in an opt-in way. It recruits people online to voluntarily form a community that demonstrates a better way of doing things.\n\nA network state can be seen as a more mature version of a startup society. It can take the form of a wholly digital network union, a partially physical network archipelago, or a diplomatically recognized network state. A network state could start as a one-person startup society and grow into a million-person entity with a global archipelago of physical territory.\n\nThe relationship between \"startup society\" and \"parallel society\" is similar to that of \"startup\" and \"tech company,\" where the former is early stage and the latter can be of any stage.\n\nSources:\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment>\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-image>\n<https://thenetworkstate.com/prologue>\n",
