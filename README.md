# Network School BRAIN

## Overview
The NS BRAIN Discord Bot is designed to streamline access to essential information for the Network School community. With a comprehensive database scraped from NS Wiki, Luma (events page), Discord channels (reception & Discussion) as its knowledge base, the bot leverages the OpenAI API to provide accurate, context-driven answers to queries posted on Discord. This makes it easier for new and existing members to ask questions related to everything going around at the Network School. 

## Features
- **Instant Answers:** Users receive prompt responses to their queries without leaving Discord.
- **Deep Context Integration:** Combines a system prompt, wiki context from Notion, and user queries to generate relevant answers.
- **OpenAI API Integration:** Uses the OpenAI API for processing queries and fetching precise responses.
